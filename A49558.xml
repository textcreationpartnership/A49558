            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Preface, To the ſeveral humour'd READERS.</head>
            <p>WEre it not more for orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and faſhion-ſake than for any thing elſe, the Devil-a-bit would I have treated you with an Epiſtle. For if you once damn a thing, an Author muſt bite his Lips, and take it as patiently as a Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker will do a Cuff on the Ear. But for thoſe that are modiſhly complaiſant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, they will uſe <hi>Evagoras</hi> as ſome do a Doſe of Wine extraordinary, vomit him up again with unwholſom Dregs brought from their own ſtomachs, I gad an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Taylor is better to be endured than an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Author, two ſuch damn'd unfaſhionable Tools, that their Needles
<pb facs="tcp:54948:3"/>and Pens ought not to be ſuffered in a <hi>Commonwealth:</hi> He hath not that <hi>gaity, briskneſs, bel humeur</hi> which have <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeurs les beaux, Eſprits de France;</hi> he's even like an honeſt Woman worn clear out of eſteem, whilſt your outlandiſh one is a Town Miſs with her grand Tou'r diſplay'd in Curles, her Gold embroider'd Bodice, three-quarters thread-bare, and her Silk Pettycoat Laced above — the foulding of her upper. Bookſellers are grown men of mode too, they ſcorn any thing of this kind below an <hi>Originally in F</hi>—in the Title Page, with a <hi>Made Engliſh:</hi> which thing conſidering, diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged me before I had half finiſhed this Work, inſomuch that I was going to martyr it in Flames, as judging that I was taking a great deal of pains in doing of nothing</p>
            <p>Now for thoſe among us that conceit themſelves the only men of Buſineſs, Sence, and Reaſon, I had almoſt ſaid Wit too, that drudg and turmoil like Kitchen-ſtuff Wenches for Greaſe, who think there's no ingenuity like creeping on all four, like an Horſe through thick and thin, in great ſweat for Provender; every
<pb facs="tcp:54948:3"/>one of thoſe you may be ſure are Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, not that they can give any reaſon why; nor that they will looſe ſo much time as to read a <hi>Romance:</hi> but their aim is to brand the Author with folly, for having ſpent ſo many Golden Hours (as they'l term them) in vain, however I wiſh ſome of them would ſpend their buſy hours a little better than I have done my vacant ones. Others there are too, whom we may juſtly call the abſolute <hi>Solomons</hi> of the Age, being a little more judicious than the former, they may think I might have made choice of a more Grave Subject to treat upon; which I anſwer, I would have done, did I not ſuppoſe Gravity in youth to be a little inconſiſtent with nature, therefore what I here writ, as I am young, was to pleaſe my youthful Fancy; had I been old then would I in the firſt place have pick'd out of the Receipt Book of the family by way of Collection, divers and ſundry Receipts to cure ſore Eyes, ſtop Rhumes, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent coughings in the night, and then I would have endeavoured to invent a new, plain and eaſy way to walk upon Crutches without ſhrinking up the Shoulders, to
<pb facs="tcp:54948:4"/>which ſhould be adjoyned a Treatiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning, and reproving the Follies of Youth, and a great many orher things, which wild youth never thinks on, for want of Gravity.</p>
            <p>The enſuing Story, as it is rather an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient than modern, is alſo more fictitious than real, for I have not tied my ſelf to the humour of any Hiſtory, but thought it better to uſe the ſcope of mine own Fancy. However I may not only in one thing preſume to ſay it is in ſome meaſure Modern, but that it hath like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſome reſemblance of truth, eſpecially in the Story of <hi>Theocles,</hi> which is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon I have been ſo particular in it, as to relate things which were they not true might ſeem of little moment; her lying with her Lover when diſguiſed in her Name, Habit, and Sex, I thought not fitting to omit, though it tends not much to the knitting together the Plot; nor her being perſwaded when in Company with ſome men, to bath with them in a Stream, and her unwillingneſs to do it, for fear of revealing her Sex: all which and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more are ſo true, that indeed to deal plainly I had no mind to leave them
<pb facs="tcp:54948:4"/>out: thus with the parties permiſſion, under covert names have I diſcloſed the Amors of ſome particular Friends of mine.</p>
            <p>The only reaſon why I call it ancient, is, becauſe the whole Story is ſuppoſed to have happened in the time of the <hi>Heathens,</hi> when they Worſhiped their ſeveral <hi>Gods;</hi> and reſorted to <hi>Oracles.</hi> However let me tell you, you will find in it nothing above the reach of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, nothing which may ſeem either to be impoſſible, or contradictory to ſenſe, or Nature. I declare this, becauſe I would not put you in a fright before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand. For you may think that I have given you a Brother to <hi>Amadis de Gaul,</hi> or <hi>Knight of the Sun,</hi> with ſome <hi>Enchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Caſtle,</hi> ſtuffed full of <hi>Elves, Fairies, Scar-Crows, Hobgoblins, Giants, Imps,</hi> and <hi>Pigmies.</hi> Which had I done, you'd have had two or three fits of the Chollick be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you could have read the Story half out.</p>

               <hi>Evagoras,</hi> A ROMANCE.</head>
            <p>IN the famous Iſland of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> at that time of the day when the bright Charioteer of Heaven had almoſt finiſhed his Career, the Prince <hi>Evagoras,</hi> with the Lord <hi>Corian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> his faithful Friend, walked upon the Golden Sands by the Sea-ſide, between <hi>Paphos</hi> and <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſia,</hi> and thus entertained one another with their paſt Calamities: My dear <hi>Coriander,</hi> ſaid <hi>Evagoras,</hi> what an unfortunate Prince am I, thus to be deprived of my Kingdom, and to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to live unlike my ſelf, that I might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue unknown to the Tyrant <hi>Aphiſtamenus?</hi> Whom my Royal Father, in my abſence, left at the Helm of Government? Alas, I too ſoon in my Travels, heard the fatal news of the King my Fathers death. But you know <hi>Coriander,</hi> what
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:54948:9"/>a ſpur it was to make me come homewards, when I heard that <hi>Aphiſtamenus</hi> ruled in my abſence; yet when I did come, was it not too late? Had he not already made moſt of my Subjects believe I was dead? And with an impudence not to be parallel'd, did he not endeavour to face me out, that I was not the true <hi>Evagoras;</hi>

               </gap> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I reſembled him, I would uſurp his Name to raiſe my ſelf to Kingly Power? Did he not infuſe this into moſt of my Subjects minds? who were ſo credulous as to believe him. Did I not ſtrait raiſe what Forces I could, to end this tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult, and let them know a true Prince from an Uſurper? Did not the too great multitudes of his men, in the laſt Battel we fought, did they not force us to give back with much loſs? And you alſo know, that when I found my ſelf uncapable of raiſing new Armies, that I cauſed a general rumor to be ſpread, that I was reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to <hi>Sicily.</hi> And in a diſguiſe, that may not diſcover us in our ſolitary abode here between <hi>Paphos</hi> and <hi>Amathuſia,</hi> we taſte as much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent as we might diſcontent at Court. Here <hi>(Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riander)</hi> is no body to moleſt us; Ambition is a ſtranger here; and Honour, the aim of haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty minds, hath here no more than its Name left. Here we are troubled with no daily fears, nor tow'ring-thoughts to enlarge our Empire, by making new Conqueſts. A ſmall ſpot of ground limits our high deſires. But ah <hi>Corian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> I could weep almoſt when I think, as I have ſince been informed, that my Father when I was very young, having deſigned me to eſpouſe the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54948:9"/>young Princeſs of <hi>Sicily;</hi> I am almoſt ready to weep, I ſay, to think, that that lovely Flower ſhould fade before it had flouriſhed three years. How agreeable this alliance would have been to me, had Heavens ſpared her, its eaſie to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine; for we had been both of an age, and in probability, by the relation of all that have ſeen her, ſhe would have been the greateſt prodigy of Beauty, as ever nature framed; how great then would have been my felicity? While they were thus ſeriouſly diſcourſing of their unhappy fate, <hi>Evagoras</hi> (who had diſguiſed his Name as well as Garb for his better concealment, by calling himſelf <hi>Agenoris,</hi> and by giving his Friend <hi>Coriander</hi> the name of <hi>Clidamant</hi>) eſpied at no ſmall diſtance from the ſhore, ſomething float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Sea, which they could not well deſcry what to be, till the Wind by little and little drove it towards the Land; and then they ſaw it was a man, who by ſome ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter accident had been expoſed to the fury of that boyſterous Element; at length by the help of the Wind he reached the ſhore, with both his hands faſt clinch'd to a Casket, which alone ſeemed to befriend him, in this his deſperate condition. Though he was void of all ſymptoms of life, yet when theſe noble Companions had both taken a more near ſurvey of his perſon, which was extream lovely and beautiful; and after they had ſpent ſome time in admiration of him, which they indeed eſteemed worth their wonder, they ſoon (when they had endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by lifting him up, and holding his head
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54948:10"/>downward, to make the water which he had ſwallowed run out of his body) cauſed him to be conveyed to the place of their Reſidence, where he was ſcarce arrived before ſome ſigns of life appeared; and by degrees he became ſenſible, inſomuch, that at length by the help of ſome Cordials wherewith they comforted him, he could walk; and after he had returned them thanks ſutable to the courtiſie he received from them, and had been informed of the Name of the Country wherein he was arrived, he beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the favour of them, to furniſh him with ſome dry attire to wear, which was ready for him before he deſired it. So leaving him to repoſe his wearied Limbs on a Bed which they on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe deſigned for him. The evening being moſt ſerene and pleaſant, calm and ſilent, the Sun ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king preparation to abſcond his beautiful viſage behind the Weſtern Hills, and bid adieu to the upper Hemiſphere till his new approach; they went to take a turn in the Grove of <hi>Venus,</hi> which for delight and pleaſure hath not its like in the Univerſe. The Caſtle wherein theſe illuſtrious Gueſts reſided, is ſeated by the ſide of this Grove, the Trees whereof are of Mirtle; a place truly raviſhing, as well for the extent and compaſs of it, as for thoſe comfortable and refreſhing ſhades with which it did plentifully abound, for the Leaves and fair ſpreading Branches of the Trees are naturally ſo united, and ſpread ſo cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly over the Valleys, that you ſeem to walk under chearful green Arbours. I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it may be more the Maſterpiece of Art or
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54948:10"/>Nature, but Art hath ſo ſubtilly imitated Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and Nature hath ſo ſweetly play'd the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt, that it would be ſomething difficult to judg; though in either it is truly admirable. In the midſt of this Grove is a ſtately Mount, as well for its heigth, as for the Trees which ſurround it, which are the ſame with the reſt, but do grow in ſuch manner, that it maketh it in form of a Labyrinth; for in every green Valley you enter, you continue ſtill aſcending till you have reached the top, but with ſuch pretty turnings and wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, that it is an object both of wonder and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. On the top is a Lodg encompaſſed with <hi>Cyprus</hi> Trees, in manner of a Circle, from whence your Eye hath a full and free proſpect over the whole Wood to the Sea; which cannot chuſe but be a lively Landskip of Nature. Near this Lodg it was, where <hi>Agenoris</hi> and <hi>Clidamant</hi> were walking, when a Voice exceeding delecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble approached their unprepared Ears, and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to proceed from the Lodg, where as yet they were not arrived; they made a ſtop, that they might hear it with more freedom, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did any thing ſurprize their Senſes in the like manner; it was ſuch incomparable Vocal Muſick, that it ſeemed rather to be cauſed by ſome Heavenly Object, than by any thing that was Earthly. And by reaſon of the ſhrilneſs of the Voice, they could give no other judgment, but if the party was of Nature's forming, it could be no other than a Woman; though ſhe ſeemed to be endued with moſt Divine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. The more willing attention their Ears
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54948:11"/>gave to it, the more willing were they to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue a patient Ear. <hi>Agenoris</hi> appeared to be in ſuch a rapture, that he imagined his Senſes would deprive him of any further pleaſure, by their readineſs to forſake him. Such was the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural power and charming efficacy of this Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial Nimph's Voice. <hi>Agenoris</hi> was unable to contain himſelf, till he had bleſſed his ſight with what he undoubtedly judged to be moſt mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous; concluding her Perſon to be as Divine as was her Voice: But yet like one enchanted, he could not move till he had heard her make an end of what ſhe had juſt begun; which were the words following, ſung beyond expreſſion.</p>

            <p>Scarce was the Song ended, but <hi>Agenoris</hi> peep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through the Trees, to get a ſight of the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; which he did, for her Face was oppoſite to that part wherein they were; and there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but a ſingle Row of Trees between, he might with eaſe behold her; which when he had done, O Gods, cried he to <hi>Clidamant,</hi> ſee yonder, the ſweeteſt object that ever mortal beheld! what bluſhing Roſes and lovely Lillies dwell in that amiable Face! Sure ſhe is ſome Goddeſs, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from the upper Regions, to delight her ſelf in theſe cooler ſhades. It is impoſſible but ſhe muſt be more than humane; her Beauty is beyond all that can be called Common. Ah <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damant,</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:54948:12"/>in that ſparkling Eye ſuch Majeſty is ſeated, as doth add a glorious luſtre to the reſt of her numberleſs number of perfections. <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damant,</hi> I muſt, I can find no repoſe till I am nearer her perſon, that from her own Lips I may know, if a Goddeſs ſhe be, as ſhe really ſeems; after what manner ſhe deſires to be ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that I may ſo do it, as to render Adoration acceptable to her; to that end, let us endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to enter the Lodg where ſhe now is. <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damant</hi> ſoon conſented to the deſire of <hi>Agenoris,</hi> and went round about into the Lodg, where they expected to have found this fair unknown one; but alas it was too late, for before they could come to her, ſhe was gone from thence by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther turning; which when <hi>Agenoris</hi> ſaw, he turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed pale, and looked as if he was going to breath out his life. I could wiſh, ſaid he to <hi>Clidamant,</hi> in a faint note, that I had ſeen her once more, for I find my deſire as yet hath found no limits; but why, I cannot tell, except it be to diſcover new perfections; though I confeſs I am too cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in that, becauſe that what I have already ſeen, hath left an impreſſion deep enough in me. Should it now turn to Love, in what a miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble condition am I? who knoweth not ſo much as where to find the object loved. I fear I am paſt cure already; and now I wiſh I had not ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed on her ſo much; and yet methinks I wiſh I could ſee her once more. How reſtleſs am I grown of a ſudden. Is it the Original of a grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Paſſion? or is it only a curious deſire of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing again what Fate has deny'd me, that renders
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:54948:12"/>me thus impatient? Surely ſomething above the nature of Curioſity has ſeized me? or elſe I ſhould never have found ſo great an alteration in me. Methinks the Divine Idea of this pretty Nimph hath taken ſo ſure a dwelling in my mind, that for my life I cannot wipe her out. And ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing I feel to ſting my heart, which doth both pain and delight me; for ſometimes the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is counterballanced by an exceſſive pain, and the pain again is eaſed by a ſenſible pleaſure; and then it is ſubject to ſuch violent Pantings, as if it would force a paſſage through my body. Have you ever been in Love <hi>Clidamant?</hi> If you have, pray acquaint me how this paſſion rules us, and whether what I now tell you, doth bear reſemblance with it; for I do not remember, that ever I felt the like agony before. No, repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Clidamant,</hi> I never yet did love, and I hope I never ſhall ſubmit to what is ſo deſtructive to repoſe, and the moſt noble part of man, the Soul: But by what I have been informed, by thoſe that have taſted the bitterneſs of it, I find I have too much reaſon to fear, that the ſight of this unknown one hath (Heaven grant it hath not) ſeduced your reaſon; and if ſo, think of the frailty and inconſtancy of that Sex, think I ſay of Woman; and if you judg right, which you will if you place your Reaſon in the ſame place it was, you will ſcorn to love ſo mean a thing as Woman, but will aſpire to ſomething more Heroick and Noble. What you call Love, if you ſummon but your Reaſon to appear, and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:54948:13"/>make uſe of your Judgment to diſcern the truth, you will find, that you have abuſed that Name for ſomething as much inferior to it, as a Peeble to a Diamond. Unkind <hi>Clidamant,</hi> ſaid <hi>Age<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noris;</hi> not only unkind, but unjuſt, thus to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane that ſweet Emblem of Heaven. Had you called them deſtroyers of poor men, nay had you called them Murderers, I could better have endured to have heard it, than to hear them named Frail, Inconſtant, and Mean; and thus to abuſe a Paſſion that is as ſpotleſs as Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, innocent as Virtue, virtuous as Humility, and as pure as Chaſtity it ſelf. And ſince I find I muſt cheriſh the fore that pains me, my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort is, that it was occaſioned by ſo ſplendid and tranſcendently beautiful an object. You, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied <hi>Clidamant,</hi> who have often converſed with the faireſt Ladies in <hi>Aſia,</hi> both at home and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad; you who in the Field have ſmiled when Blood and Death hath encompaſſed you, will you ſtoop to the ſoft Enchantments of a Woman; remember, great Sir, that now it is the worſt of times to ſubmit to Love. You muſt caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Banner of <hi>Venus,</hi> and bravely put on that of <hi>Mars.</hi> Now is the time, becauſe the preſent ſtate of affairs requires it. Appear once more in the Field, Sir, and let <hi>Aphiſtamenus</hi> ſee, how much your great heart diſdains him. This, and much more he ſaid, to cauſe that riſing Flame to ceaſe, that had already poſſeſſed him; but it was all unavailable, for it did but make it burn the fier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer. After they had entertained each other, with theſe and the like Diſcourſes for ſome time,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:54948:13"/>they thought upon the Stranger, and went ſtrait towards the Caſtle, and entred both into his Chamber, whom they found awake; they firſt made an apology for their long abſence from him, and afterwards asked him, if he had found any refreſhment ſince they left him. His an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers were ſo exceeding courteous and obliging to what they demanded, that he even charmed <hi>Agenoris</hi> and <hi>Clidamant,</hi> with the ſweetneſs of his behaviour; <hi>Agenoris</hi> had already ſo great an eſteem for him, and <hi>Clidamant</hi> thought he ſaw ſomething ſo ſingular in him, that he could not forbear acquainting him, how de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous he was to be ranked among the number of his choiceſt friends; wherefore with much humility he beg'd the favour, to know how he ſhould call-what he ſo dearly eſteemed. Sir, replied he, I cannot but be very ſenſible how much your noble Friendſhip exceeds my poor deſerts, who am no other than a Stranger to you both; however ſince you have conferred the honour of your Friendſhip on me, I find my inclination not undiſpoſed to embrace ſo great a happineſs; unleſs it be becauſe I know my ſelf as yet not to have merited it. He ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have a ſpecial amity for <hi>Clidamant,</hi> and no ſmall reſpect for <hi>Agenoris,</hi> though his Eye was ever fixed on the firſt, with a more than ordinary outward ſhow of tenderneſs; and in truth it may be ſaid, that Friendſhip never appear'd to be more ſincere than it did afterwards between <hi>Clidamant</hi> and this pretty Youth. They deſired at length of him the knowledg of his late mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune;
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:54948:14"/>whereto he gave them ſome ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though but ſmall; and they were loath to preſs him too much, becauſe they perceived by the meaſures he uſed, that he had ſome moſt urgent reaſon to conceal the greateſt part of his adventures from them; notwithſtanding he told them, that if they pleaſed they might call him by the name of <hi>Theocles,</hi> and that his Father was Governor of a Town in the neighbouring Iſland called <hi>Creet;</hi> and that his occaſions calling him to ſail for <hi>Lydia,</hi> the Ship wherein he was being, driven upon the <hi>Cyprian</hi> Coaſts by contrary winds and foul weather, it chanced to run with great violence againſt a Rock, where it ſplit all to pieces; and that when he found himſelf ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the mercileſs Seas, that it was his lucky fate to lay hold of a ſmall Box, which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved the Mariners had caſt over-board with many other Goods to lighten the Veſſel, and which he now perceived to be his own; by the aid whereof it appeared that he was carried above the water towards the ſhore, where they had found him: And now, ſaid he, how ſenſible I am of thoſe courteſies I have received from you, nothing but my own grief can expreſs, for not knowing in what manner to repay them; and indeed they do far exceed what-ever can be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered. They both of them in the moſt obliging language they could, were paying him their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments for what he had now related to them, when they judged it time to retire, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the night was pretty well waſted away; and therefore after the uſual Ceremonies in ſuch caſes,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:54948:14"/>they left him to his repoſe to ſeek their own. But before the Sun had drunk up the Morning-dew, they aroſe with an intention to entertain him, and were ſcarce entred his Chamber when <hi>Agenoris</hi> eſpied his fair Kinſwoman <hi>Emilia,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready performing the Office he deſigned to do a perſon endued with all the choiceſt Gifts of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. I need not make a particular deſcription of her Perfections, ſince it is but gueſſing what might be thought moſt worthy of admiration to judg of her. In the time the Court flouriſhed, ſhe was thought by all that beheld her, to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine the brighteſt Star there. She followed her Kinſman <hi>Agenoris</hi> where-ever his deſtiny led him, and was now an Inhabitant with him in his ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; as were alſo two Illuſtrious Gentlemen who were her faithful Adorers; they both equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly admired her, whereby they forſook the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer friendſhip in which they lived, and became Rivals, and by conſequence enemies one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. They neither of them yet had revealed their griefs to her, but by their ſighs and eyes, of which ſhe did ever ſeem to take little notice. The name of the one was <hi>Periander,</hi> who indeed was of an age that could add no great luſtre to Love. The other was called <hi>Orontus,</hi> a perſon endued with great Merit, and one whoſe Youth did ſeem to argue on his behalf, what the waſted years of the former ſeemed to oppoſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Agenoris</hi> with his Friend and Kinſwoman, after very pleaſant diſcourſes of Gallantry (<hi>Theocles</hi> not being in a condition to make up the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to help to paſs away the time) all unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:54948:15"/>agreed to take a walk in the Plain that fronted the Grove; wherefore all retiring to a private corner of the Chamber till <hi>Theocles</hi> was dreſſed, which was not very long, they went to execute this their deſign with very much content and pleaſure; only there appeared a ſmall altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the brow of <hi>Agenoris</hi> ever ſince he had ſeen the unknown Lady, inſomuch that he found ſome difficulty to ſuit himſelf to the chearful humors of the reſt of the company. They had not walked far under the tuition of a pretty row of Trees, that elevated their ambitious branches over the middle of the Plain, but they were ſurprized with a claſhing of Swords which they heard on the other ſide. <hi>Agenoris</hi> and <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damant</hi> were preſently ſo curious, as to the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of themſelves, to diſcover who they might be; and to their no ſmall trouble, they found it was <hi>Orontus</hi> and <hi>Periander,</hi> and with eaſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently imagined the original cauſe of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat, and did not unjuſtly attribute it to <hi>Emilia:</hi> they had ſcarce ſpied <hi>Agenoris,</hi> but more out of reſpect to him, than a good will to themſelves, they deſiſted fighting. After he had embraced, and ſolicitated them to be friends, he brought them to the reſt of the company; where, when he came, he revealed it all to <hi>Emilia,</hi> who had long ſuſpected what ſhe then knew. <hi>Agenoris</hi> therefore conjured her to decide the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy, ſince it was ſhe, and none but ſhe could do it; and withal deſired to know of them whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they would willingly ſubmit to her judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſince they muſt not both expect to be
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:54948:15"/>equally loved by her: to which they with much ſeeming willingneſs anſwered affirmatively. Thereupon <hi>Emilia</hi> bid <hi>Orontus</hi> hope, but not ſo much as ſhould make him preſumptuous: and ſhe deſired <hi>Periander</hi> neither to deſpair nor hope, but to content himſelf with a mean be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween both. They would have replied to her ſpeech, which they reckoned dubious, had ſhe not beckned to them to be ſilent; and then ſhe proceeded, and deſired them to urge her to ſay no more upon that ſubject, and to let their minds reſt ſatisfied with it; and withal gave them a ſevere check for quarrelling, and a ſtrict com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to abſtain from the ſame for the future, under the penalty of being utterly baniſhed from her preſence: And ſhe farther ſaid, if you both love me as you pretend you do, you will be mindful of the laſt injunction I have laid on you. By their ſilence they ſeemed to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg themſelves guilty, and to manifeſt how much they dreaded to offend her. <hi>Agenoris</hi> was ſomething diſpleaſed with <hi>Emilia,</hi> and did even almoſt chide her for giving them ſo little ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction: however, what ſhe had now ſayed, ſhe would neither revoke nor enlarge upon.</p>
            <p>When they had fetched two or three turns in the Plain, they deſerted it, to reſort a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to the Caſtle, which was their only Houſe of Pleaſure; though <hi>Agenoris</hi> enjoyed but little in it, ſince his heart was firſt filled with Love; and as the hours, minutes and days encreaſed, ſo did a deep melancholy in the ſpirit of <hi>Agenoris,</hi> to the great affliction of all his Illuſtrious Friends,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:54948:16"/>who never omitted any thing that might tend to his diverſion. One day, among others, to pleaſure him, <hi>Clidamant, Orontus,</hi> and the reſt conſulted, becauſe the heat of the weather made it not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable, to go and bath themſelves in a pure Criſtal-ſtream, which was privately ſeated near the wood, and ſhaded with many goodly <hi>Sicamore-trees;</hi> the very place did ſeem to invite them to it; they went and took <hi>Theocles</hi> with them, who would have excuſed himſelf upon pretence of ſtaying at home to entertain <hi>Emilia</hi> and ſome other Ladies of her Train during their abſence; but they would admit of no excuſe, becauſe they deſiree <hi>Periander</hi> to perform that office. <hi>Orontus</hi> would fain have accompanied him, if the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany would have permitted him, but they abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely refuſed it; ſo that he was conſtrained to give them an unwilling obedience, and to be one among them. When they were arrived at the place where they were going, they all began to diſcharge themſelves of their apparel, except <hi>Theocles,</hi> who would by no means be perſwaded to uncaſe him; no arguments were ſtrong enough to make him condeſcend to it; the water, he ſaid, did not agree with him, and that he could promiſe himſelf no great pleaſure by it: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, at length, after many entreaties, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would not be leſs Complaiſant than the reſt of the Company, he willingly pulled off his lower attire of ſhooes and ſtockings, but would go no further; inſomuch, that holding up his breeches a little above the knee, he thus entred the water; and <hi>Clidamant,</hi> whoſe eyes were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:54948:16"/>fixed upon him, ſeemed ſtruck with admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratlon at the extream whiteneſs of his skin, which was truly lovely, for no Snow could be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to it. Sure <hi>Theocles,</hi> ſaid he to him ſmiling, Nature hath not framed you with theſe common ingredients with which ſhe hath the reſt of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, for to the colour of thoſe delicate Limbs, the pureſt Ivory looks black. He bluſhing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, that he ſaw he could exerciſe his wit, though it were upon never ſo mean a ſubject; I have ſeen men (ſaid he) <hi>Clidamant,</hi> whoſe skins are far whiter than what you are pleaſed to ſay of mine; however, I find you have only a mind to rally, for you your ſelf I ſuppoſe know, that a white skin is no ſuch rarity in men, though it be ſo common in women. <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damant</hi> made no reply, becauſe they were all preparing to come forth again; which when they were, they rallied upon <hi>Theocles,</hi> for not doing as they had done, telling him, that he ſeemed to have more of the Woman in him than Man, by reaſon of his excellent ſhape, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure and complexion; and that if he was what thoſe tokens did outwardly intimate, he ought to have been excuſed. <hi>Theocles</hi> replied, he hoped they would not unman him, by cheating them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into that unlikely belief; and he who had pulled off the leaſt of his apparel, was the firſt that was ready, which when they were all, they walked to the Caſtle with much chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: the Moon beginning to elevate her horned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face above the <hi>Horizon,</hi> and from behind a foggy-cloud to diſpel the darkneſs of the night, every
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:54948:17"/>one was glad to ſeek their repoſe till the dawning of the day-light; and no ſooner was <hi>Aurora</hi> adorned in her Scarlet-robe to beautify the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come morning, nor no ſooner were the little Birds in every Grove warbling their good-mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows in chearful notes to the glorious day, but this Illuſtrious Family had all forſaken their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of repoſe; eſpecially <hi>Agenoris,</hi> whoſe love to the Beautiful ſtranger did every day rather increaſe than diminiſh; and as it is uſual for thoſe that are in love to be deprived of their reſt, <hi>Age<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noris</hi> his love-ſick mind would afford him none during the whole night, but forced him to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake his pillow ſomething early. <hi>Periander</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, whoſe diſcontent increaſed more and more ever ſince <hi>Emilia</hi> gave him, as he thought, ſo much cauſe to deſpair, and his Rival, <hi>Orontus,</hi> ſo much reaſon to hope, as by the ſenſe of her laſt words he imagined, ſhe too plainly manifeſted; he departed at that early hour into the Fields and Woods, there to endeavour, if it were poſſible, by his complaints, to extract pitty from the Marble-rocks, the hollow Ecchoes, and the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Groves. <hi>Orontus,</hi> on the other ſide, who imagined <hi>Periander</hi> the happy man in the eye of his Miſtreſs, and himſelf the only miſerable, was likewiſe infected with the ſame malady with his Rival; and, as is cuſtomary for thoſe that are in love, eſpecially ſuch who imagine themſelves the ſubject of their Miſtreſs's ſcorn, to ſeek privacy and ſolitarineſs to utter forth their lamentations, without any other witneſſes than inſenſible ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: Even ſo the oppreſſed <hi>Orontus</hi> ſought the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:54948:17"/>ſame manner of ſolitude as did <hi>Periander,</hi> and not only ſo, but, as it hapned, they met together in one and the ſame place: I need not tell you af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter what manner they beheld one another, nor the manner of their ſalutation, which was cold enough; but in the end, notwithſtanding the Charge given them by their Miſtreſs, <hi>Periander</hi> began firſt with expreſſions of ſweetneſs to win <hi>Orontus</hi> to reſign up his right in <hi>Emilia;</hi> which way of proceeding beging ineffectual, he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued with threats; but <hi>Orontus</hi> being one whoſe Love was too firm to forſake him, and whoſe Heart was too couragious to be daunted, told him, he would rather reſign up his Life than his Miſtreſs. Then replied <hi>Periander,</hi> you muſt; the place wherein we are, is private enough, and it is fit that either you ſhould fall or I, ſince we cannot both enjoy her; the Prize doth well enough merit our diſpute: Therefore <hi>Oron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> draw, for I am reſolved to end this diſpute on equal terms. <hi>Orontus</hi> at firſt ſeemed very unwilling to act ſo raſhly; and withal asked him, if he had forgot the Command ſhe laid on them. <hi>Periander</hi> gave little heed to his words; ſo jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous was he of looſing ſo great a Treaſure; but ſwore by all the Gods, if he did not defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he would then kill him as he ſtood; and to make good his word, proceeded to make a Paſs at him. Then <hi>Orontus</hi> drawing his Sword, cried out, The Gods be Witneſſes with what conſtraint I do this thing; Deareſt <hi>Emilia,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give me. After which words, he took no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther care, but to ſtand upon his Guard, and with
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:54948:18"/>what dexterity he could to put by the Paſſes of his Adverſary; and though ſeveral opportunities lay open to him to take his advantage of <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> yet would he make no uſe of them, but ſtood only upon the defenſive part. <hi>Periander</hi> obſerved it, and grew the more enraged, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that redoubling his thruſts, he fell on like Lightning, and making an Home-paſs at <hi>Oron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> his breſt, he skilfully put it by, though not ſo well, but that it coming with great force, gave him a ſlight hurt in the ſhoulder, which he ſoon perceiving, did then begin to deal ſome thruſts, and preſently gave him another in the left-arm, and immediately cloſing with him, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed him. <hi>Agenoris</hi> and <hi>Clidamant,</hi> who at a diſtance had ſeen the latter end of the Combat, were juſt come to them to learn the occaſion of their Quarrel. And as there was nothing they would conceal from him, they revealed to him the occaſion of their Combat, after they had counſelled them to renew their friendſhip with all the winning Arguments imaginable, and had conſtrained them to make an unwilling Embrace of each other, <hi>Agenoris</hi> deſired <hi>Clidamant</hi> to conduct them to the Caſtle, and to ſee their wounds dreſſed, while he enjoyed himſelf in the Fields; they all obeyed, and being gone, <hi>Age<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noris</hi> wandred from one ſolitary place to another, entertaining his mind with his ill-deſtiny in the ſad loſs of what he found he ſo much admired, till at length he approached the ſide of a ſilent Wood, where ſitting down upon a Flowry-Bank, by a ſweet muſical Stream, he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:54948:18"/>to give his ſorrow vent, by ſinging what follows:

            </p>
            <p>After which he breathed Sighs which were capable of moving Compaſſion in the very Trees themſelves. Ah! how happy are thoſe, ſaid he, that are ſlighted by the Fair-Ones they adore! their Sighs and their Moanings may nouriſh them with the hope of cauſing Compaſſion to make way for Love: But I lament, and ſhe to whoſe Ears it ſhould arrive, is altogether igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of my ſufferings; nought but the dumb objects of Woods, Rocks, and Valeys, are wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of my Complaints; ſometimes ſome flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:54948:19"/>Eccho doth ſeem to ſend me Comfort, and aſſoon deprive me of it again; the little Birds do ſometimes lament me, and then again, as if they took delight to diſpleaſe me, in malicious Notes of joy, they ſeem to make a mock of my miſeries; the very leaves too of theſe Trees, in their ſilent whiſperings, do likewiſe ſeem to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire againſt me, and ſome objects I meet with that intermingle pleaſure with my pain; but thoſe are ſoon vaniſhed again, and overſwayed by a burdenſome grief, to admire her I once ſaw, and to be deprived of her ſight; I now admire to receive the tender impreſſion of Love with ſo much joy? when my eyes were firſt made happy with her ſight, and to cheriſh the wound with that eagerneſs as I then did, and do ſtill, and to be thus bereft of the only pleaſure I hoped to enjoy of her preſence. Unkind Fates! why did you let me ſee her, if I muſt no more? Ye Gods, be favourable to me in my ſearch of her: and Love, be thou my fortunate Guide; no Grove nor Thicket, no wild-Foreſt, nor craggy-Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain will I leave unſearched till I have found her I love, and, were it poſſible, I would ſearch even in <hi>Paradiſe</hi> it ſelf, a place not unlikely to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour a Compoſition ſo Celeſtial; could I but ſee her once more, though ſhe would not admit a Cure, her Pity would at leaſt leſſen my ſufferings, and her Preſence would make the Pain more pleaſing: In ſaying this, he advanced ſome ſteps upon the Green that lay before the Wood, where looking towards his left-hand, upon a lively and flowry riſing of the ground, he eſpied a Flock of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:54948:19"/>Sheep nibbing on the graſs, and on the top of all, under the fair ſpreading-branches of a comely Tree, ſtill approaching towards that place, he might diſcern one attired like a Shepherdeſs, with a Crook in her hand, in long diſhevelled Locks, and in a careleſs Garb, though not ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, but the Party it incloſed did make it appear to be very graceful; her Apparel was more plain than rich, yet not ſo plain, but Majeſty ſeemed inthroned in what was moſt plain; her Head was graced with an hat, or rather her Head graced the Hat, which, though the materials wherewith it was compoſed were but homely ſtraw, that hindred it not from being extreme pretty. No ſooner had <hi>Agenoris</hi> with great aſtoniſhment viewed theſe things at an indifferent diſtance, but he heard the noiſe of an Horn as from behind the Wood, and immediately there preſented to his ſight a furious wild-Boar, which was running with much celerity directly towards the place where he ſaw the Shepherdeſs; he, without much conſultation with his thoughts, drew his Sword, and made what haſt he could after it, he came juſt as he had rent her Veſture, and was going to devour that fair One, where <hi>Agenoris</hi> joyning Courage to his dexterity, made it appear, that if Nature had rendred him know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the one, Art had not made him leſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced in the other; for approaching the Boar, and making two Paſſes at him, he run him in at his Shoulder, and it came out again at his Neck, upon which he fell down; but the Furious Monſter feeling himſelf wounded, and, as if he
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:54948:20"/>had gathered new ſtrength in his fall, gets up again, and leaps at his Adverſary, and now it ſeemed as though <hi>Agenoris</hi> muſt expect inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ruine by a lamentable death; the Pretty Shepherdeſs trembled, and looked pale for fear of this Stranger, leſt his too great Courage ſhould undo him: But <hi>Agenoris,</hi> who thinks no Laurels greener than thoſe that are reaped in the midſt of dangers, ſtands firm upon his Guard againſt his furious Attacks, and taking his time, runs him in again in the Flanck, inſomuch that at length, in an heavy groan, his life left him; then was it that laying down his Bloody Sword, he approached the Nymph; but, good God, how was he aſtoniſhed! how great was his joy when he knew her to be that Fair One that firſt aſſaulted his heart in the Wood, and though ſhe had appeared moſt excellently Beautiful there, yet here ſhe appeared ſo incomparable Fair, that ſhe did even lay a new Siege to the place that was already ſurrendred; in the Grove he thought he ſaw but one Beauty, but by the perfect ſurvey his eyes now made, he perceived thouſands in one face, and in the ſame moment his eyes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a more neer enquiry, diſcovered ſomething in her that made a ſhew of Greatneſs and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, and therefore with a moſt Reverend Zeal he Accoſted her in theſe words;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Beautious Nymph, how careful the Gods are of what is moſt Heavenly, they having made me the happy Inſtrument of protecting you from the fury of this Monſter, does witneſs ſo great a wonder of Beauty ſo near a reſemblance, of what is moſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:54948:20"/>could never be deſtined to be a Prey to that rude Animal: The Gods themſelves, had they not uſed me, would doubtleſs by ſome more ſecret Power have reſtrained his fury; nay, had the Monſter himſelf beheld your Charms, he would gently have lain down, and fawned upon what he purpoſed to have deſtroyed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moſt Noble Sir, replied the Shepherdeſs, I muſt confeſs my Thanks are too poor a Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for ſo large a Service, yet, as it is not in the Sphere of my power to make a Return ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Act: I hope you will accept of them as the beſt, and as the greateſt Return I can make. But after you have thus been the Protector of a poor Maids life, be pleaſed to neglect thoſe Praiſes, which are due to none but Perſons of Honourable Extraction, but not to me, alas; whoſe mean Birth dare not claim them. If your eye makes you think me Fair, as your tongue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth, believe it to be deluded; for the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of my ſelf teacheth me the contrary. <hi>The Sun</hi> (replied <hi>Agenoris</hi>) <hi>that giveth light to, and beholdeth all the objects of Nature, yet can it not behold it ſelf: Even ſo, Rare Virgin, the Gods were not the Authors of that lovely Face to make it admire it ſelf, but to raiſe admiration in others; and what though you are pleaſed to think your Birth mean, the greatneſs of your Soul, and the Charms that dwell in that Face, do ſay your Birth is more than Noble.</hi> Much more his paſſion cauſed his lips to utter, to which ſhe as readily replied; and among many other things he demanded of her, he preſumed to enquire whether ſhe was Born in
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:54948:21"/>this <hi>Iſland,</hi> to which ſhe anſwered affirmatively; and whether her Parents were alive, and how he might call them? Mother (ſaid ſhe) I have none, for my Fate hath deprived me of her; but my Father is a poor Shepherd of this Countrey, and lives in a ſmall Cottage on the back-ſide of the Wood, where I am told I was Born. My Father is called <hi>Melintus,</hi> and I am known among the Shepherds and Shepherdeſſes of this <hi>Iſland</hi> by the Name of <hi>Melliſſa. Agenoris</hi> paid her his thanks with much ſubmiſſion, for the ſatisfaction ſhe had given him, and then with much diſcretion revealed his paſſion to her; and if it may be ſaid that ever any Virgins heart was inclined to pitty at the recital of a Lovers flame, ſurely hers was: He gave her a full relation of his having ſeen her in the Wood, and how he deſigned to come to the ſpeech of her, and touching the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable condition he hath remained in ever ſince, for not knowing where to find her. To all which ſhe ſeemed to liſſen with much attention; and in truth it may be ſaid, the preſent joy of <hi>Agenoris,</hi> to ſee her heart was not of Marble, made him be forgetful of his paſt afflictions: And now (ſaid he to her) ſince Fortune hath been ſo kind to let me enjoy that happineſs I leaſt expected, I hope you will not kill me, but let me live in your eſteem. Here <hi>Melliſſa</hi> interrupted him, ſaying, What can you expect, Sir, from a Shepherds Daughter? to be your Bride will diſhonour you; and though I have no Riches, I have ſo great an eſteem for Virtue, that I'll rather loſe my Life than taint my Reputation; in retaining which, I
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:54948:21"/>enjoy a Wealth not to be exchanged for that of <hi>Croeſus;</hi> and though Honour is thought to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit no-where but in Princes Palaces, yet is there a ſort of Honour in the Cottages of Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds, (though but an homely Dwelling, you will ſay, for Honour;) but ſuch is it, that Virtue her ſelf is ever cheriſhing and defending it from falſe allurements, and unjuſt pretences. You ſay you love me, Sir, do not endeavour to cheat my Innocence, for if it be as you ſay, you do love me for ſome end or other: If you deſign to make me your Bride, your proceeding to me thereby will ſeem juſt, but to you diſhonourable, becauſe of my mean condition. If your deſign be to abuſe my Chaſtity, Virtue, that glorious Guard of Honour, bids me tell you, that you muſt never dare to ſee me more. The Gods them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, replied <hi>Agenoris,</hi> are witneſſes that my flame is too pure to wrong ſo much Innocence, and too innocent to abuſe ſo much Virtue: I ſhould wrong Heaven it ſelf, were I but guilty of ſuch an unjuſt thought! I only beg you would receive an unfeigned Heart that loves you, and that you would pronounce me in ſome meaſure either miſerable or happy! Pitty, pitty this poor Heart that lives only by you, and ſeeks no other dwelling but your dear Breaſt. Alas! replied <hi>Melliſſa,</hi> ſuppoſe I ſhould love you? and indeed I find I have little reaſon not to eſteem you; I I ſhould love you too well to undo a Perſon of your Worth. However, live Sir, and live in my eſteem, but never live to enjoy a miſerable Maid like me; except Fortune had raiſed me
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:54948:22"/>to a degree of Bliſs, whereby I might have deſerved you. Ah cruel <hi>Melliſſa!</hi> (ſaid he) you give <hi>Agenoris</hi> life by commanding him to live, and in your eſteem; yet ſeem to kill him again by that heart-breaking word [never!] he muſt never enjoy thee! Alas! thou art too deſerving for me already, thou art rich enough in natural Riches; thou art able to make Princes happy! Adorable <hi>Melliſſa!</hi> dart down then a Ray of Comfort upon thy comfortleſs <hi>Agenoris,</hi> and revive his Heart with the warmth of thy Love, which muſt otherwiſe break. If Modeſty be a Virtue, ſaid <hi>Melliſſa,</hi> ſo is likewiſe Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; if it be Immodeſty then to grant a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Requital to him that hath hazarded his own Life to ſave mine, I may then be ſaid to abuſe that commendable Virtue: but ſince the World doth not uſe ſuch unjuſt conſtructions, I will paſs a grant upon what you ask me. It is Love, you ſay; come, you have it, <hi>Agenoris;</hi> and though a Fort doth ſeldom ſurrender at the firſt Artack, yet to you, <hi>Agenoris,</hi> you ſee it does; the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice you even now did, may make me excuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and doth make me ſenſible of what I owe to a Perſon like you: but though you have my Love, my cruel Fate will not permit me to give you that Requital you may merit, and as I could wiſh; for as you ſeem to be a Perſon of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, I am, you ſee, but a poor, gentle, harmleſs Shepherdeſs, one that would not willingly wrong her ſelf, nor have any body wronged by her; eſpecially you, who are my Life's Preſerver: therefore if ever you loved to grant the deſire
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:54948:22"/>of her you ſay you love, let me intreat you not to endeavour the haſtning to your diſhonour, by the enjoyment of miſerable Me, but reſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with the knowledg that I love you; yet if Fortune ſhould change her Face towards me, which ſeems not likely, on lawful and honourable terms make me yours; if not, think it never can be; yet this conſolation I will afford you, <hi>Agenoris,</hi> that no body ſhall reap what by you was not obtained, and for your ſake I'll die as innocent as I was born. Since, ſaid <hi>Agenoris,</hi> your Decree is ſuch, I muſt ſubmit, and will live, if it be but to gaze upon thoſe ſparkling Eyes, and in gazing I'll enjoy what I ſo dearly love. That ſweet concordance of Colours in that love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Face doth almoſt ſeem to ask me, if deſire is not limited; therefore what can be more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable than to behold a ſight ſo glorious? Much Diſcourſe to the ſame effect, which was very charming and paſſionate, paſſed between them; till being inquiſitive how and where he might enjoy the happineſs he now did, once more? ſhe gave him to underſtand, that in the ſame place where ſhe now was, he might every pleaſant Evening find her attending on her Flocks; and that as his Birth ſeemed honourable, ſhe hoped his Actions would ſpeak him no leſs, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhould not be againſt that freedom he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, ſince he looked like one who would make no ill uſe of it. After he had paid her his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voirs for the good opinion ſhe ſeemed to have of him, he for that time took his leave of her, but with an intent to renew his Addreſſes to her
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:54948:23"/>the next day, which he accordingly did, taking <hi>Clidamant</hi> with him; and when they came, they found that <hi>Melintus</hi> her Father was with her, who ſhewed them a Reſpect almoſt equal to what their Qualities required: and having been informed by <hi>Melliſſa</hi> how the brave <hi>Agenoris</hi> had been the Protector of her Life, it is not to be imagined with what kindneſs they were received by <hi>Melintus,</hi> which was not ill rerurned by <hi>Age<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noris;</hi> who after ſome indifferent Diſcourſe with him, did earneſtly ſolicit him and his Daughter, whom he highly reſpected, to be his beloved Gueſts, and to forſake their Sheep to accompany him to the Caſtle, where he reſided: Many Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, as well <hi>Clidamant</hi> as <hi>Agenoris</hi> uſed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they could prevail with them to leave that ſort of life wherein they found ſo much content: But at length, what by the force of very rich Preſents that they preſented to <hi>Melintus,</hi> and offered to <hi>Melliſſa,</hi> though ſhe would except of none; and what by moſt tender expreſſions of Love and Good-will, they in the end perſwaded him and his Daughter to accept of a Lodging far different from what ſhe then had: ſo giving the Charge of his Sheep to another Swain, they guided their ſteps to their place of Habitation; and having acquainted his other Gueſts of thoſe he had newly received, who did all of them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely admire the Beauty of <hi>Melliſſa,</hi> and did not unjuſtly imagine that ſhe deſigned more than to be a Shepherdeſs, and thereupon gave her a Reception ſuitable to her Merit, and not to what her Quality ſeemed to ſpeak her; and a Chamber
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:54948:23"/>was provided for her, with a Maid to attend on her Perſon, to the great joy and comfort of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lintus,</hi> vvho knevv that <hi>Agenoris</hi> had an heart full of Honour, and vvas not ſo abject as to do her any violence; he likevviſe knevv his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's to be proof againſt all enticements, and therefore vvas not a little glad of the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and though the Preſents hehad given him by <hi>Agenoris</hi> vvere ſufficient to make him forſake the Title of a Shepherd, yet the peace and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs he found in that life, vvould not permit him to leave the ſvveetneſs of it; inſomuch, that though he had changed his Cottage for a ſort of Palace, he vvould ſtill each day frequent the Plains, as vvould alſo <hi>Melliſſa,</hi> to guard the harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Lambs: <hi>Agenoris</hi> himſelf too, for her ſake, vvould not ſcruple to take up the Sheephook to attend on her; vvhere, as he ſat on the green Hillocks by her ſide, he vvould divert her vvith the Stories of unhappy Lovers, and pulling out his Flute, vvould beguile the time vvith its Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lody, as ſhe vvould vvith her vvell-tuned Voice. He vvould never permit her to reſort alone to the Plains, neither vvould he be ever ſatisfied but vvhen he vvas in her preſence: and on the other ſide it vvas evident that ſhe found not his paſſion diſpleaſing to her, nor vvas ſhe uncapable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the ſvveet ſting of Love; hovv agreeable vvere his Sighs to her, and hovv charming the expreſſions of his Love! But let us leave theſe avvhile, to endeavour to eaſe our other Lovers; and firſt let us learn the immediate cauſe of their ſeveral ſufferings, vvhich could not be vvith more
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:54948:24"/>caſe gueſſed at, than by an Adventure vuhich hapned one day, to the general amazement of all the Company: It vvas after <hi>Agenoris</hi> vvas re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from attending on his <hi>Melliſſa</hi> in the Plains, vvhen being entred the Caſtle, and into a lovver Room, vvhere <hi>Emilia, Theocles,</hi> and others of the Company were, he ſaw <hi>Clidamant</hi> with much eagerneſs, as the Company all imagined, Courting of the Fair <hi>Emilla;</hi> while <hi>Theocles</hi> walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed chafingly about the Room, as though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing had given him cauſe of offence. <hi>Agenoris</hi> addreſſed himſelf to him, and perceiving him to look diſcontentedly, asked him the cauſe? Ah <hi>Agenoris!</hi> ſaid he, if ever you did bear any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to my Friend <hi>Clidamant,</hi> or me; or if ever you knew what true Friendſhip was, I conjure you by thoſe Tears which you ſee trickle down my Cheeks, by whatever you hope for of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, and by the Love you bear to <hi>Clidamant,</hi> to deſire him to deſiſt from Courting of that Lady; ſomething I could tell you, that might perhaps move your heart to do the thing I deſire of you, if what I have already ſaid would not; but ſeveral Reaſons oblige me to conceal it, till ſuch time as it makes a voluntary appearance of it ſelf; beſides, I have made an Oath not to do it: by that ſtrong Argument then, though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to you, and whatever it be, let me im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore of you to fulfil my will in this. You know, I ſuppoſe, with what ſincerity <hi>Emilia</hi> is already Adored by the two Rivals, <hi>Orontus</hi> and <hi>Periander;</hi> ſuffer not <hi>Clidamant</hi> then to obſtruct their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, for I queſtion not but ſhe may one day
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:54948:24"/>ſmile on one of them; conſider then ſeriouſly of what I ſay, and without asking me any other Reaſons than what I have told you, for my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus urgent in this Affair; uſe your utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt power to put a ſtay to his proceedings. <hi>Agenoris</hi> was ſomething ſurprized at this Diſcourſe, and told him, that if his deſire aimed at his Friends good Fortune, he ſhould rot contemn the preſent Actings of <hi>Clidamant,</hi> ſince the Lady he ſeemed to love, was both Fair, Honourable, and Young; for which Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he ſhould rather rejoyce at it, than ſeem to be confuſed and troubled. O never! never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe this thing to me, ſaid <hi>Theocles,</hi> if you do you kill me! <hi>Agenoris</hi> then ſeeing him ſo eager in his intreaty, though he was not able to diſcern the occaſion of it, promiſed him to make uſe of all the power he had to prevent it; and withal. deſired him to reſt ſatisfied till he had effected it. <hi>Theocles</hi> had no ſooner paid him his Acknowledgments for the promiſe he had now made him: but <hi>Agenoris</hi> left him, and went ſtrait towards <hi>Clidamant</hi> and <hi>Emilia,</hi> to the end he might break off their Diſcourſe, if it were of Love, as he could think no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: after then ſome indifferent Diſcourſes with them both a-while, he took <hi>Clidamant</hi> aſide, who was ever his truſty Confident, to eaſe his diſtreſſed mind, by entertaining him concerning his Beloved Shepherdeſs. Ah <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damant!</hi> (ſaid he) had you but ſeen and heard with what a Grace ſhe pronounced that which muſt be the cauſe of my future Hope, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:54948:25"/>Deſpair, your ſurprizal would have been great; and then gave him to underſtand what progreſs he thought he had made in that Fair-One's heart; and <hi>Clidamant</hi> could not chooſe but contribute with him in his joy, though for his own part he found but little cauſe; for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received a wound from the Eyes of the Fair <hi>Emilia,</hi> and imploring her relief, her Rigour had almoſt made him deſperate; for in ſtead of finding Love, he found her Hate: <hi>Agenoris</hi> then diſſwaded him from loving <hi>Emilia,</hi> and ſhewed him how unjuſt it was to ſeek to deprive <hi>Oron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> and <hi>Periander</hi> of that Happineſs they laid claim to before him, for which they but now would have ſacrificed eath others Lives: All his Arguments were in vain; it was enough to know he loved to apprehend he was obſtinate; for which cauſe <hi>Agenoris</hi> ſaid not much more to him, but induced him to accompany him to ſee the two Rivals wounds, which were not very conſiderable; and afterwards, becauſe it was late, to their ſeveral Apartments, and ſo to their reſt. But when day-light had conquered darkneſs, every body with much willingneſs left their Beds, eſpecially <hi>Orontus</hi> and <hi>Perian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> whoſe wounds being pretty well again, were both of them upon going to give a Viſit to <hi>Emilia;</hi> but with what face to do it, ſince they had both been regardleſs of her laſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, they knew not: However, <hi>Orontus</hi> ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined himſelf to be leſs Criminal than his Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, becauſe he was provoked to do what he did in defence of himſelf; with this aſſurance
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:54948:25"/>then, though ſeized with a certain awful fear of ſome juſt puniſhment from her, for what ſhe thought him guilty, he ſaw her firſt, and in humble kneeling told her, that he was come to ſue a Pardon of her, for a thing, which though in her Eyes might make him ſeem altogether Criminal, yet when ſhe ſhould know what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation occaſioned it, and the neceſſity he was in either to die upon the point of his Rival's Sword, or to uſe his own in defence of that Life he was every minute ready to ſacrifice for her ſake, he hoped ſhe would in ſome meaſure leſſen the ſeverity of that Decree he ſaw ſhe was every moment ready to pronounce againſt him; and though this laſt Action of his might bear the outward form of negligence, yet was his Will altogether obedience. But, <hi>Madam,</hi> ſaid he, (riſing up) if what I have done does make me black with guilt before you, let me receive my puniſhment from your Fair Hands: when he had ſaid this, he opened his Breaſt, drew his Sword, and offering it to her, ſaid, here Madam, give your diſobedient Servant that which he hath juſtly deſerved, and let him be bleſt with Death from your Fair Self, which will be ſo welcome a Favour, that in dying he ſhall think you have been kind, becauſe you will then deprive him of a Life which would have been worſer than ten thouſand Deaths to me, ſhould I have lived in your Hate! Here Madam, (proceeded he, in opening his Broa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> wider) let out this guilty blood! ſtrike, Madam and ſtrike home! But ſhe only turning her Face
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:54948:26"/>aſide, and bidding him put up his Sword, told him, no; that though the Crime of which he was guilty, had given her a juſt cauſe of offence, yet was not her aim at his Life; for you may live, ſaid ſhe in a ſaint note, — but not to love me; you may find enough, whoſe Deſerts and Beauties are far more powerful to inſpire Love, than any thing you can ſee in me. I ſhall not baniſh you my ſight for what you have done, becauſe I ſee ſomething in your Face that ſpeaks a ſilent penetence; but yet I muſt conjure you never to ſpeak more of Love to me, one word of it hereafter condemns you to an everlaſting Exile. She had ſcarce pronounced this heavy Sentence on poor <hi>Orontus,</hi> but <hi>Periander</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, and at her Feet was going to ſpeak his ſubmiſſions, when ſhe prevented him, in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſhe wondred how he dare intrude himſelf into her Preſence after what he had done! ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding withal, that it was in vain for him to ſpeak, for ſhe would hear nothing he ſhould alledg in his Vindication: Madam, ſaid he, trembling, I come not here to plead Innocence, but like a Priſoner at the Bar, I wait for that puniſhment I merit: and, Fair Judg, as it's you only that muſt pronounce the Sentence, it's you only that muſt inflict the ſeverity of your Indignation. Since it is ſo, <hi>Periander,</hi> ſaid ſhe, I charge you never to ſee me more! and without one word more of Reply, riſing up from the ground, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a low Bow with the Tears in his Eyes, and a down-eaſt Look; Madam, ſaid he, you ſhall be obeyed, and Farewel for ever! yet let not
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:54948:26"/>my Memory be odious to you, though my Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be: ſo ſaying no more, he went dejectedly out of the Room, followed by <hi>Orontus,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, with all imaginable privacy, he departed from the Caſtle, to the no ſmall wonder of <hi>Age<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noris</hi> and <hi>Clidamant</hi> when they miſſed him; they both had a particular kindneſs for him, and were therefore the more afflicted at his unexpected abſence: that he would betray them to the Tyrant, they had too long experienced his Fidelity to judg ſo ill of him; but that which moſt perplexed them, was, the knowing themſelves ignorant of the cauſe of his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. <hi>Orontus,</hi> who though he had not ſo much cauſe to deſpair as <hi>Periander,</hi> yet was his heart ſeized with a deep ſorrow, becauſe ſhe had forbid him the very naming of Love to her; and what ſhe would not hear him name, he knew ſhe would leſs ſuffer in him; how to eaſe his heart of this confuſed grief, he knew not, his Reaſon was too far gone to be recalled to ſubdue his Paſſion, and baniſh her from his mind: many thoughts diſturbed his Fancy, which would make him ſometimes reſolved to do one thing, whilſt others again did as ſoon can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel that reſolution to introduce one more new. By theſe means he would endeavour a preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of deſpair, till one thought ſeeming of more force than the reſt, gave him ſome hope and encouragement to put it in execution: with this in his mind then, he found out <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> to whom he related how ill his Miſtreſs requited his Love, likewiſe telling him, that
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:54948:27"/>never any ſerved a Lady ſo cruel and rigorous! <hi>Theocles</hi> extremely lamented his misfortune, and with all the tender words a compaſſionate heart is able to manifeſt on ſuch an occaſion, did throughly expreſs his inward ſorrow; for which <hi>Orontus</hi> gave him thanks, and told him, that ſince he did endeavour to comfort him in his diſtreſs, he hoped he would uſe his utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt power to lift him out of that miſerable Gulph in which her cruelty had unhappily caſt him, and that then he ſhould not be altogether overcome with that deſpair, which will other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe put an end to his Liſe; and that if he would grant what he was going to demand of him, it would be ſo great a comfort to his reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs thoughts, and ſo great a joy to his heavy heart, that it would infuſe new life in him! <hi>Theocles</hi> anſwered him, that he might be ſure he would not be backward to perform any ſervice he ſhould command him, more eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what tended to his ſatisfaction and welfare; and therefore deſired him to give him to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what it was he requeſted? and that if he was capable of doing it, his endeavour therein ſhould manifeſt the truth of his Friendſhip. Then was it that <hi>Orontus</hi> told him, in a manner which did plainly demonſtrate his inward grief, that his only Requeſt to him was, to find out <hi>Emilia,</hi> and to uſe all the means and expreſſions that Love can dictate to her, to induce her to leſſen her Severity towards him; and, if it were poſſible, to perſwade her to revoke that rigid Sentence. <hi>Theocles</hi> bid him be aſſured
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:54948:27"/>that he would compaſs what he deſired of him, and to expect good news in a ſhort time; for he would hunt this Cruel-Fair ſo often, and would uſe ſuch means, that if nothing elſe would, his importunities alone ſhould make her ſubmit to what tended to the contentment of his mind. It was not to be feared that <hi>Theocles</hi> would in the leaſt decline from performing what he had promiſed him: his averſion being ſo great to ſee <hi>Clidamant</hi> Court her, it's to be imagined that he was glad of the opportunity, and therefore without any farther delay he went to make good his word.</p>
            <p>There hapned one day an Adventure which we muſt not here omit, no leſs ſtrange than pleaſant, and occaſioned by <hi>Agenoris,</hi> who had left his own Chamber, and neſigned it to <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſſa</hi> the firſt night of her Arrival; and though <hi>Clidamant</hi> had been his former Bedfellow, yet being at this time deſirous to repoſe alone, that he might enjoy himſelf and his thoughts more freely, he intreated <hi>Clidamant</hi> to lie with <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> who had hitherto lain by himſelf: <hi>Clida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant</hi> went immediately to him to let him know who was to be his Night-Companion; which when <hi>Theocles</hi> heard, he ſeemed to ſtartle, and his Colour, like the ebbing and flowing of the Tide, aſcended into his Face, and vaniſhed away again two or three times, as if it had proceeded both from ſhame and anger; but for what it's unknown: However, his preſent ſurprizal being ſomething over, he faintly told <hi>Clidamant,</hi> that he was but a troubleſome Bedfellow, and that
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:54948:28"/>he was given ſo to tumble in the night, that he was certain he could enjoy no Repoſe with him: but all his Reaſons were miſunderſtood by <hi>Clidamant,</hi> who would lie with him notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his refuſal. <hi>Theocles</hi> ſeeing he could not prevail with him, and that he would give no Ear to his excuſes, ſeemed very much per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed; and among the reſt of the confuſed Speeches he uttered; Well, (ſaid he) <hi>Clida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant,</hi> will you admit of no denial then? if not, know that I am— Here he made a pauſe, as if he was thinking of what he was going to ſay: But (ſaid <hi>Clidamant</hi> to him) what are you, <hi>Theocles,</hi> content, — anſwered he? To do what, replied <hi>Clidamant?</hi> not to lie, ſaid <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> in ſome kind of confuſion, and making ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pauſe; with me, ſaid <hi>Clidamant;</hi> without you, ſaid <hi>Theocles,</hi> — and with a ſeeming willingneſs he lay with him, and they went to Bed together at the ſame time that the reſt of the Family retired, vvho did all enjoy their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in a plentiful manner, except <hi>Orontus,</hi> whoſe unkind uſage from <hi>Emilia</hi> would not permit him to cloſe his eyes; he was therefore the firſt that got up in the morning, and was very curious to know how <hi>Theocles</hi> would ſucceed in what he had promiſed him; <hi>Clidamant</hi> did ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond him, and had been as reſtleſs as he, by reaſon <hi>Emilia</hi> was as great a torment to him as ſhe had been to the other: Being dreſſed, and in a readineſs to quit the Chamber, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived <hi>Theocles</hi> to be awake, becauſe the light that came from the Window darted upon the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:54948:28"/>Bed, he ſavv it being pretty broad, that he vvas crept as far tovvards the other ſide as he could poſſible be; 'tis no great ſign (ſaid <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damant</hi> to him) that you are a troubleſome Bedfellow, as you told me laſt night; for at that diſtance which I am certain you lay from me all night, you could not well be as you ſaid; and of all the men that I have lain with, never did I meet with one that lay more ſtill and quiet than your ſelf; and to ſpeak the truth, I almoſt doubted at midnight whether I had you in bed with me or no; for though I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to give my ſelf that ſatisfaction by feeling for you under the Bed-clothes, yet could I not reap it, for you were not to be found. In ſaying this, and without ſtaying for his Reply, which he was going to make, he gave him the Good-morrow, and then went forth of the Room to find <hi>Agenoris,</hi> who had been up very early to walk out ſome-whether with his Dear <hi>Melliſſa,</hi> as it was ſuppoſed, to divert themſelves, they had appointed it the foregoing night. <hi>Agenoris</hi> and <hi>Clidamant</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorted to her Chamber, and knocking at the door, to demand of the Maid that was ſet to wait upon her, permiſſion of her Miſtreſs to viſit her, ſhe prevented them by coming to the door her ſelf to bid them enter, and after the uſual Ceremonies on ſuch occaſions, they were going to do what was deſigned by them, and to walk out in the freſh Air; but becauſe they would do it privately, they urged <hi>Clidamant</hi> to
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:54948:29"/>ſtay behind, who would otherwiſe have waited on them; they told him that in two hours time they hoped to return, becauſe the heat of the day would be unpleaſant to them, that <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phos</hi> ſhould limit their intended Walk. <hi>Ageno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> would have taken the Coach, had not <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſſa</hi> preſſed him to the contrary, becauſe ſhe imagined it would be more delightful for them to go on Foot, and likewiſe conſidering the little way they had to go. <hi>Agenoris</hi> believed it would be unneceſſary to take any of his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance with them; the Morning was fair, and ſo early was it, that the Sun had not as yet given them a ſmiling Salutation by his appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; they departed then, and not ſo much as a Page with them, only <hi>Agenoris</hi> carried with him a ſmall Casket full of the richeſt Jewels he had, with an intent to Preſent it and them to his <hi>Melliſſa:</hi> They had not been long gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the Family had with much eagerneſs quitted their Beds, and with much earneſtneſs made their enquiries after <hi>Agenoris</hi> and <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſſa</hi>'s welfare, more eſpecially <hi>Emilia,</hi> who was diſturbed with a dream that did make her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe altogether bitter and unpleaſant, imagining it to be a Portent of ſome unlucky Adventure that might happen upon thoſe whom it moſt concerned, and could not refrain from being ſtruck with a ſudden grief; the cauſe whereof ſhe related to <hi>Clidamant,</hi> who took but little notice of it, and made anſwer, that Dreams were but imaginary Realities, occaſioned by the riſing of Vapours into the Head, when
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:54948:29"/>Sleep doth ſway as Emperor of the Night; but when we wake we find thoſe Images all vaniſh, and then we come to know that it's only the continual, employment of the unwearied Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, which are too Aetherial to ſleep like the Body, that ſtamps thoſe Images into our minds. It was reported of a man, Fair <hi>Emilia,</hi> ſaid he, who being faſtned in Irons, and in a ſtrong Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, yet when he ſlept would his flattering Dreams create him King over many Rich Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, thereby giving him as well an univerſal Power as Liberty, yet when he waked, thoſe joys were all vaniſhed, and he found himſelf ſtill in Fetters. The Miſer likewiſe dreams he finds heaps of Treaſures, continues very unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied when he wakes, and then comes to know that it was but his deluded Fancy. I my ſelf, Charming <hi>Emilia,</hi> have often dreamed I have ſeen you ſmile on me! but alas, I could ſay it was but a Dream too. Judg then whether you may have any cauſe to fear, from any thing you have dteamed this night? I know not, replied <hi>Emilia,</hi> but I am in a ſtrange apprehenſion of ſomething: If the Company will be pleaſed to give attention, they ſhall hear the Original cauſe of that which occaſions my trouble: the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany who were preſent intreated her to do as ſhe ſaid, which ſhe very obligingly did, in theſe words; <hi>If</hi> Agenoris <hi>and</hi> Melliſſa <hi>are well,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>it's a great folly to judg a Dream ominous, but if they are not, I have much reaſon to imagin the contrary, by this Nights Viſion; for I was no ſooner aſleep, but</hi> Agenoris, Melliſſa, <hi>and my ſelf,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:54948:30"/>methought, were walking in a pleaſant Green-Meadow by the Sea-ſide, where leaving them to go another way, when I wàs at a certain diſtance from them, chancing to look behind me, I perceived about a dozen Tygers that iſſued out of a dark Den hard-by, who ran with open-mouth upon them to deſtroy them; and fancying that I had heard</hi> Melliſſa <hi>give a grievous ſhrick, the fright of it waked me!</hi> Now the Gods grant, ſaid ſhe, that no harm may betide them. If, ſaid <hi>Theocles,</hi> I were curious to regard Dreams, I might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be equally concerned with you; <hi>for I likewiſe dreamed that</hi> Agenoris <hi>and</hi> Melliſſa <hi>were both taken by</hi> Aphiſtaminus <hi>the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper of this</hi> Iſland; <hi>and that imagining</hi> Agenoris <hi>to be</hi> Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras, <hi>the true Heir to this Crown, who is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be gone to</hi> Sicily, <hi>he laid him in a dark Dungeon, and had loaded him with as many Chains as his Body could well bear, and that he had kept</hi> Melliſſa <hi>in a private Chamber with an intent to Raviſh her: But juſt as I was about dreaming that he was giving order to a Ruffian to murder him, I awaked. Clidamant</hi>'s Colour changed extremely while he was relating this Dream, and by his eyes might be diſcerned ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward perplexity; he went preſently to <hi>Oron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> and <hi>Emilia,</hi> and told them whiſpering, that he could not chooſe but be ſomething moved at it; if it were only that <hi>Theocles,</hi> who knew him not to be a Prince, ſhould dream of him as one, and ſhould dream that he was made a Prey to <hi>Aphiſtaminus,</hi> who would doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs make him ſuffer more than his Dream ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:54948:30"/>could he find him: And now was it that <hi>Clidamant</hi> repented that the Prince did not leave the Kingdom to have avoided theſe dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; he could not reſt till he had ſent ſome of his Servants to make enquiry after him, for now more than two hours were ſlid away ſince he firſt departed. He immediately went and ordered ſome to go towards <hi>Paphos,</hi> ſome to the ſood, and ſome to the Sea-ſide. And while <hi>Clidamant</hi> was thus employed, <hi>Theocles</hi> being deſirous to perform what he had promiſed to <hi>Orontus,</hi> found out <hi>Emilia</hi> to Accoſt her on his behalf: I have a Suit to you, Madam, ſaid he, what is it, <hi>Theocles?</hi> anſwered ſhe. Madam, ſaid he, I dare not let it arrive to your know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, except you will firſt promiſe to hear it ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably, and afterwards to grant it; it's no trifle, Madam, ſaid he, ſince it concerns life, What is it you demand? ſaid ſhe; let me know on whoſe behalf you plead? if what you ask of me does not exceed the Rules of Civility and Honour, perhaps I ſhall not refuſe what you deſire. Then, Madam, replied he, Mercy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing much to your Honour, I hope you will now let it ſhine as brightly among the reſt of your Perfections, and appear with as glorious a Luſtre as doth a Diamond among a number of other precious Stones; that you may ſave the Life of miſerable <hi>Orontus,</hi> leſſen then your ſeverity: <hi>Periander</hi> is no more to be heard of, you have condemned him to Exile; come, you muſt love <hi>Orontus,</hi> I muſt not be denied, nay, I told him I would not be denied; pray ſmile
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:54948:31"/>upon him, and do not wiſh him harm. I wiſh him none (ſaid ſhe) <hi>Theocles,</hi> with a ſigh, but I muſt not love him, nay, I cannot; ſince you can plead ſo well for your Friend, (ſaid ſhe ſmiling,) what a becoming Orator would you be for your ſelf, if you had occaſion? but pray deſiſt from ſpeaking any more in his behalf, for fear my weakneſs ſhould make me ſubmit not to deny you. Ah Madam! added he, did you but know how ſincere his Love is! did you but know how little he enjoys himſelf! and did you but know what deep-fetched ſighs he breaths for your ſake, certainly your Pitty would intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Love! Pitty him I do, (replied ſhe, bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,) becauſe I cannot love him; and that's all he may hope for from me; yet tell him I would have him live. She ſpoke this in a kind of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted manner, and with a faultering ſpeech, and a look extremely wild; and fain would ſhe have revoked her words, but that ſhe thought it too late, becauſe they were already uttered. <hi>Theocles</hi> rejoyced exceedingly for having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained thus much of her on his Friend's part, and therefore with many thanks to her for the ſame, he left her, to carry the poor Lover the chearful News; which he had no ſooner told him, but it ſeemed to him almoſt incredible. And does <hi>Emilia</hi> bid me live! ſaid he; can ſhe then pitty her languiſhing Lover? As Storms at Sea do for the preſent make the deſpairing Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men prepare for unwelcome Death, yet when by ſome miraculous Fate the roaring Winds ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly ceaſe, and the briny Ocean does once
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:54948:31"/>again wear a ſmiling Calm, it doth in ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner chear up the Heart of the mournful Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that his preſent joy cauſeth him to forget his paſt miſery: Even ſo this unexpected Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing which <hi>Emilia</hi> hath conferred upon me, does ſo revive my drooping Spirits, which were once periſhing in the frightful Sea of Deſpair, occaſioned by her ſtorms of Cruelty, that the deſire I once had to die, to be eaſed of my ſad pain, is changed into a pleaſant deſire I have to live: Since it is likewiſe by her command, brave Sir! ſaid he to <hi>Theocles,</hi> in embracing him; the remembrance of that ſingular Favour you have now done me, is too great not to be acknowledged, which I am ſorry I can no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe do, than by bearing the unfeigned Title of your Obliged Servant; too ſmall a Requital for ſo noble a Courteſie. <hi>Theocles</hi> returned his Complements after a very gallant manner, and then left him to ſearch for <hi>Clidamant,</hi> to learn of him whether he had yet heard any news of <hi>Agenoris</hi> and <hi>Melliſſa,</hi> who ſorrowfully told him that the Servants were returned, but could hear nothing of them, except it was thoſe that took their way towards <hi>Paphos,</hi> who informed him, that after enquiry made there after two ſuch perſons, they had been ſeen in the Temple of <hi>Venus: Clidamant</hi> ſeeing all his endeavors to find them were unprofitable, was ſenſibly grieved, as was likewiſe Old <hi>Melintus,</hi> as vvell for the abſence of <hi>Agenoris,</hi> as for the loſs of his Daughter: But much more vvere all their ſorrovvs increaſed, vvhen novv they had vvaited
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:54948:32"/>vvith longing expectation to learn Nevvs of them, till the Sun had half finiſhed his Courſe through the tvvelve Heavenly Signs, and yet nought could be heard of them: then vvas it that all Hope began to forſake them; then vvas it that their Tears did once more manifeſt hovv much they ſuffered by ſuch a loſs; but time at length made them conſider, that ſince there was no other Remedy, they muſt be conſtrained to reſt unwillingly contented. And indeed <hi>Clida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant,</hi> however ſorrowful he was for the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Prince, yet was he not in the leaſt neglectful of paying his Devoirs to <hi>Emilia,</hi> which in the ſame moment did ſeem very much to perplex <hi>Theocles,</hi> though <hi>Clidamant</hi> perceived it not; his ſmall ſucceſs in his Application to her gave him great diſpleaſure, and ſmall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to proceed, though Love perhaps might be of force to make him endeavour to reſiſt his Fate; notwithſtanding which, his trrouble was apparent enough; for he would ſometimes ſeem to rave, and in his ordinary Diſcourſe would often breath out <hi>Emilia</hi> at un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares! how to heal his mind he knew not, till on a certain day a ſudden thought poſſeſſed him, and he reſolved to viſit the Temple of <hi>Venus</hi> at <hi>Paphos,</hi> and thence to learn his Deſtiny, and to know whether he might ever obtain the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs he aſpired at, he ſoon proſecuted his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign; where ſaluting the Prieſt, and deolaring the occaſion of his coming, he found admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance into the Temple; and being ſilent till the uſual Ceremonies to the Goddeſs were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:54948:32"/>formed, he, by the inſtigation of the Prieſt, did kneel down, and made the enſuing Prayer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Great Goddeſs! thou who art not only the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verneſs of poor Mortals preſent Fate, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of their future: Thou, who alone, canſt make Lovers happy, and art the only Ruler of our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections: Thou who canſt trace the unbeaten Paths of the Soul; and art the true <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niter of all plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing deſires; grant the Humble Supplication of a Love-ſick Mortal, and reveal to him whether he may extract any thing of Sweetneſs from what doth appear to be moſt Cruel? or whether Cruelty may continue to Reign in what doth bear the outward form of much Sweetneſs? whether the Heart of her he affecteth hath any room to entertain Love? or whether Love may make him hope for a Return from the Heart by him affected?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having ended his Prayer, the Altar before which they were planted, ſeemed to give a deep-groan, and the hollow and retired Vaults of the Temple, like diſtant Thunder in loud whiſperings, to preſage that the <hi>Oracle</hi> was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſpeak; which in a faint, though plain Voice, it did in theſe following words:
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:54948:33"/>
               <q>
                  <lg>
                     <head>The Oracle.</head>
                     <l>Thou doeſt to Love pretend, but lov'ſt not well;</l>
                     <l>And art not lov'd, yet there's none can excel:</l>
                     <l>A Love ſo true, as is for thee in ſtore,</l>
                     <l>In <hi>Venus</hi> Grove the Gods will tell thee more.</l>
                     <l>Neglect not then t'embrace that courteous offer</l>
                     <l>The Gods themſelves will thee that moment proffer.</l>
                  </lg>
               </q>
            </p>
            <pb n="51" facs="tcp:54948:33"/>
            <p>Scarce was the <hi>Oracle</hi> ſilent, but <hi>Clidamant</hi> departed with much diſtraction in his thoughts, and diſcontent in his looks; for he found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as much unſatisfied as he was before, in vain therefore did he often endeavor to unravel the ſenſe of what he had heard; it ſeemed all along to him ſo palpable a contradiction, that the more he ſtudied, the more he found his thoughts incumbred, though he imagined the latter end did plainly ſeem to flatter him; but yet for two or three days he continued very melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, keeping his Chamber, and deſerting Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany in ſo ſtrange a manner, that it raiſed an aſtoniſhment in all that knew him, although thoſe who knew him well, attributed it to the abſence of <hi>Agenoris:</hi> the third day he ſeemed not altogether ſo ſorrowful, nor was he yet in the leaſt danted at the ſeveral Repulſes his Miſtreſs gave him, but renewed his Suit to her with as much, or rather more eagerneſs than he had done formerly, which in the ſame inſtant did raiſe many Clouds in the Brow of <hi>Theocles,</hi> who with a troubled Countenance immediately departed the Room; though <hi>Clidamant,</hi> who was otherwiſe employed, took no notice of him, and ſtill continued to endeavor to ſoſten the heart of <hi>Emilia;</hi> but alas it was in vain, for ſhe perſiſted to be more rigorous to him than ever. <hi>Orontus</hi> on the other ſide faired better, ſince <hi>Theocles</hi> had ſpoke to her in favour of him; ſhe would not now be diſpleaſed, or at leaſt not ſeem ſo, when ſhe heard the name of Love pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced by him; notwithſtanding which his
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:54948:34"/>doubts were not cleared, and which way her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations did tend he could not tell; he found but little reaſon to think himſelf an inhabitant in her thoughts, becauſe ſhe took ſo little no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of his pain; for meeting her once in the Garden in one of the <hi>Terras-walks,</hi> and with much difficulty finding an opportunity to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain her; Madam, ſaid he, (after ſome other Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dourſe,) long have I loved you! long have I ſigh'd for you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and every moment am I dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet have I been ſo far from ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining your Love, that I perceive you have no room left for Pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

If ſo, Deal Madam, vouchſafe, me the Grace to let me know it, and you ſhall ſoon be deprived of one whoſe Life is hateful to himſelf, if it be to you: She made no anſwer all this while, but ſeemed to be in a profound ſtudy, which made <hi>Orontus</hi> with the tears in his eyes thus to proceed again. Madam, you are regardleſs of my miſery, and ſeem deaf to my complaints<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> You who are the Directreſs of my Deſtiny, can you be the cauſe of my Ruine? You who are the Bright Star by which I may ſteer to the Haven of Bliſs, can you take pleaſure to make a Faithful Lover deſperate? What was it <hi>Orontus</hi> ſaid? replied ſhe, as if ſhe had been newly rouzed from the Region of the Dead, or from a buſy Slumber. I ſay, Madam, continued
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:54948:34"/>he, that your cruelty hath killed the moſt faithful Lover that ever was, though the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of a ſmile from you raiſes him again, that fair viſage methinks appears too innocent to the view, to give the heart encouragement to harbour Cruelty; thoſe eyes are too bright to cauſe deſpair, and that Mouth too pretty to pronounce the Sentence of Death. Alas <hi>Orontus,</hi> anſwered ſhe, I was thinking of the Prince—and did not well underſtand what you were ſaying; but what I told you, when <hi>Agenoris</hi> was inquiſitive with me to end the difference between you and <hi>Periander,</hi> is my anſwer now; with which I would deſire you to reſt ſo well contented, that you will impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune me no more in this affair, eſpecially now when I would be private. <hi>Orontus,</hi> whoſe only deſire was to pleaſe her, did readily ſhew his obedience, and in an humble manner took his leave of her, he himſelf imagining his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany at that time to be a trouble to her, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe her deſire was to be alone; where we will leave her to her privacy, and return to <hi>Clidamant,</hi> whom we lately left entertaining the ſame Lady, but being treated by her more like one ſhe hated than one ſhe loved, he likewiſe left the room immediately after. <hi>Theocles</hi> and his heart being ſtuft with the fumes of an exceſſive Melancholy; he went by himſelf into the Grove of <hi>Venus,</hi> their to conſult his thoughts what he had beſt to do, where it would ſometimes come into his mind to deſiſt loving a Miſtreſs that ſo ill requited his love, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:54948:35"/>after he would think it lay not in his power. Thus did he continue walking under the ſhady trees with his thoughts always in motion, though irreſolute and wavering, when as Fate would have it, caſting his eye towards a pleaſing ſhady Ally on his right hand, he eſpied <hi>Theocles</hi> walking in a poſture not unlike himſelf, looking downwards, his hat over his eyes, and his Arms croſs his breaſt, <hi>Clidamant</hi> drew near him; tho he this while ſaw him not till he came very near him, and then his voice at firſt ſtartled him; for ſaid <hi>Clidamant</hi> to him, dear <hi>Theocles,</hi> why in this diſpairing poſture? what is it diſturbs your mind? you ask me what I may demand of you, replyed <hi>Theocles,</hi> (in a very indifferent manner) were it not that I know you court the fair <hi>Emilia</hi>—what (added he) hath ſhe withſtood your addreſſes? will ſhe not be kind <hi>Clidamant?</hi> has ſhe given you a repulſe? can you not work a ſmile from her. You deride me <hi>Theocles,</hi> anſwered he, in my misfortunes, which is not like a Friend; and though ſhe makes it her glory to laugh at what ſhe cauſes me to ſuffer, methinks you that pretend to be my Friend ſhould rather afford me ſome pitty. But ſaid he again, Ile give you no more cauſe to rally me, for I am reſolved to ſubdue this ſtubborn paſſion, and to triumph over her charms, that I may taſte more ſweetneſs in my life then now I do. <hi>Clidamant</hi> replyed <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> that I more than pretend friendſhip to you, here is a heart can ſurely teſtify, and thee ſteem I have for you is greater than you believe it is; for in laughing at your preſent ſuffering, as you
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:54948:35"/>call them, I do more like a friend than if I ſhould cheariſh you in your proceedings; but No, No, <hi>Clidamant,</hi> make love to a ſtock or ſtone, or to any other inſenſible object, and then judg whether you may not find as much ſweetneſs there, as in your tyranical Miſtreſs. I ſhall not go to lay before you how unlikely your love to this Lady is to prove effectual, becauſe the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience you already have had hath I ſuppoſe now made you ſomething ſenſible of it; then putting on a more ſerious Countenance, but do you think it poſſible ſaid he to do as you ſay? can you ſhake off the unprofitable Chains of that fair one? if you can tell me, I do reſolve to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, anſwered <hi>Clidamant,</hi> and am in hopes of being ſucceſsful; ſuppoſe then ſaid <hi>Theocles,</hi> that I ſhould beg permiſſion of you, to chuſe you a Miſtreſs whom you might perhaps not think unhandſome, and whoſe love to you ſhould exceed the formers hatred, would you not think this change too equitable and be more deſirous to free your heart from the imperious captivity of ſo cruel a Conquerer, to beſtovv it on one vvho vvould endeavour to pitty your ſufferings, and apply remedies: Alas ſaid <hi>Clidamant,</hi> theſe are vain ſuggeſtions, deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful dreams, and meer deluſions; but were it ſo, and the Lady you thus propoſed to me fair, virtuous, and endowed with all the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Emilia,</hi> except her cruelty; I am apt to think that her Fetters would of themſelves drop off to receive ſofter and milder from ſuch a one as you ſpeak of. Since then ſaid <hi>Theocles</hi> you
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:54948:36"/>have thus revealed your thonghts to me, and have given me a poſitive anſwer to the thing I demanded of you; Wonder not, if I now tell you, that ſince my arrival into this Iſland I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a ſingular accquaintance with a Lady be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween this and <hi>Paphos,</hi> who by my procurement hath often ſeen you, though unſeen by you, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſhe is not altogether deſtitute of thoſe qualities you deſire in a Lady, you would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to: ſuch eſteem ſhe may have for you, which when you throughly come to know, you will find you have reaſon to cheariſh; if I have revealed more to you, than her own modeſty would ſuffer were ſhe here, if ever you know her, as you are a <hi>Gentleman,</hi> I doubt not but you will give ſuch a favourable conſtruction of her behaviour as ſhe moſt deſerveth. Its the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral diſcourſe of them that know us both, to report her to be extreamly like me, and indeed nature hath made her features ſo concordant with mine, that we have often been taken for fiſter and brother: Now if you will promiſe me utterly to reject <hi>Emilia,</hi> and to take no Wife but what I ſhall chuſe, you may ſometimes ſee her. Let the <hi>Gods</hi> witneſs, replied <hi>Clidamant,</hi> I do faithfully promiſe it; though <hi>Emilia</hi> ſtill may Iodg in a corner of my heart and mind, yet I doubt not but the ſight of this beautiful Lady you ſpeak of, and the remembrance of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers cruelty will expel her quite; it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that any Lady can ſmile on me, did I not know thee <hi>Theocles</hi> to be a real friend, I ſhould not believe thee, I am ſo aſtoniſhed at it, that I
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:54948:36"/>do almoſt think my fancy deluded; yet ſaid he again to himſelf ſoftly, this muſt be the proffer I was adviſed too by the <hi>Gods:</hi> I muſt not, nay I find I cannot refuſe it, the place I am in is <hi>Venus Grove,</hi> and then ſaid he more loud I do reſolve to embrace this happineſs, and do here abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly promiſe to take no Wife but ſhe you ſhall chuſe for me; if ſhe be like you <hi>Theocles,</hi> I ſhall in truth think her not unhandſom; I have often wiſhed that the tranſmutation of Sexes were real, that you might immediately commence Woman; for whereas now being a man, though the eſteem I have for you is not ſmall, were you a Woman, my Love to you would be boundleſs. But when? ſaid he, very eagerly, where? and how ſhall I ſee this ſweet Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? Soft, ſaid <hi>Theocles,</hi> I have not yet done; you ſhall ſee her preſently; ſo putting his hand in his Pocket, he pulled out a Picture in a Caſe of Gold, embelliſhed with Precious Stones, and gave it to <hi>Clidamant;</hi> here, ſaid he, take a view of this, and keep it till you have ſeen the Original, which in a proper time you may likewiſe. <hi>Clidamant</hi> obſerved this Picture as one that had been altogether deprived of ſenſe, he had not ſo much as the power to move a ſtep forwards, but ſtood ſtill to take a ſtrict view of all the parts of it. Gods! ſaid he to <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> this does far exceed all that I could imagine to be moſt Beautiful! and how far does this Face excel the deſcription you made of her? if her Idea or Copy then be ſo excellent, doubtleſs her Perſon muſt be Incomparable;
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:54948:37"/>for the Painter could not be ſo cunning ſure, but he hath miſſed ſome of the beſt Features; and though he hath repreſented a Skin whiter than Alabaſter, yet I am apt to fancy he hath not brought it to the clearneſs of hers: then, ſaid he, firſt looking upon the Picture, and then upon <hi>Theocles,</hi> in truth this hath a near reſemblance of your Features; and yet methinks I ſee ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in you that ſeems to exceed ſome Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections in this Face: however, this is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of a Treaſure worthy of our won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and now I find I have no more love for <hi>Emilia,</hi> than juſt as much as may make me ſay I do not hate her. A Star of the firſt Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude is glorious, ſo is <hi>Emilia;</hi> but as the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Sun doth far exceed that, ſo doth this dazling Beauty out-ſhiue the Brightneſs of hers; and though my eyes were never bleſs'd with the ſight of this Fair Object; yet may I ſafely ſay, that never any had a love in ſtore for thoſe they never ſaw, like that which lies concealed in my Breaſt for her.</p>
            <p>Thus they diſcourſed while they walked, he admiring what he ſaw, and <hi>Theocles</hi> giving him encouragement to continue his admiration, till they came to a ſolitary place in the Grove, where the thickneſs of the Trees combined to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, to make a thicker ſhade than in the other parts of the Wood; which, though lone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, was exceeding delightful: Thither were they no ſooner arrived, but they were ſurprized with a mournful note, as it were of complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings iſſuing from the thickeſt parts of thoſe
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:54948:37"/>Trees near which they were; they ſtood ſome time a little ſtill to liſten, and thought they ſhould know the Voice; and ſoftly approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a little nearer, they could diſtinguiſh what he ſaid; which was very pittiful, and much after this manner;</p>
            <p>Ye Powers! why have you deprived me of the only comfort I had of my Life, and let me live? No, no, my only joy! now is the time! now is the time! I muſt follow thee! when my Soul in Airy-miſts, pure and white as the Love I bear thee, ſhall aſcend and meet thee in the middle Region; where ſitting on a Golden-Cloud, I'll fly into thy Downy Boſome, whoſe ſoftning Charms ſhall melt me into Dew; when being ready to drop down upon the Flowers here below, thy powerful Beauty ſhall (like the Sun) raiſe me up again; then in each others Arms we will gently fly from that lower part through a more refined Air, till we have reached the Starry-Orb; and in the Milky-way we will ſpend ſome time in chaſte Embraces, and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filing Kiſſes; and to the Harmony of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Sphere we will dance our way into <hi>Elizi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> where we will obtain all pleaſing Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; where we will be Crowned with everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Love; and where we will triumph over Death, and obtain leave of the Gods to make it our perpetual abode. I am coming, <hi>Melliſſa!</hi> ſaid he, I am coming! Pretty Nymph! when he ſaid this, <hi>Clidamant</hi> chanced to get a ſight of him through the Trees; when he was juſt going to fall upon his Sword, they both ruſhed in, and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:54948:38"/>prevented him, and were not a little glad of it, becauſe they firſt heard, and then ſaw that it was the loſt <hi>Agenoris,</hi> ſo long mourn'd for by all that knew him. He was a little aſtoniſhed at their ſudden coming upon him; but being come to himſelf, ſaid he to them, endeavouring to get from them, when I was here before, I took you both for my Friends, but this action of yours doth now make me believe otherwiſe: If you had a reſpect for me, you would ſuffer me to do what I would with my ſelf, ſince what I do is for my own eaſe, and future happineſs. Do you think I muſt out-live <hi>Melliſſa?</hi> nay, do you think I can? theſe eyes, ſaid he, theſe wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed eyes were witneſs of her cruel death! I will therefore deprive them of ſight by mine! they would not conſent to what was ſo injurious to himſelf. After they had given him ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, they perſwaded him to go with them to the Caſtle; where, when he was come, he was welcomed with all the joy they were capable of expreſſing, which did plainly evidence how generally he was beloved by them all; yet when they ſaw his humour ſo altred, and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly ſo predominant in him, we are not able to think how great their trouble was. <hi>Emilia</hi> was diſcontented, and <hi>Clidamant,</hi> notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his late cauſe of joy was ſad. <hi>Theocles</hi> was very much intereſſed, they were all unſatisfied till they could know the Original cauſe of <hi>Age<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noris</hi> his affliction, and which they believed they ſhould never know till they could find him in a condition to relate his Adventures, that they
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:54948:38"/>likewiſe might know where he had been all this time; they were ſilent for ſix or ſeven days, but afterwards they preſumed to intreat him; and though he knew it would but renew his ſorrow to relate his ſufferings. Yet ſince nothing could leſſen it but the ſight of <hi>Melliſſa</hi> living, and ſince they were his Friends that importuned him; he one day began his Story in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>

Then did vve behold the Divine Statue to tremble, ſvveat, and to vveep in ſuch a manner, that vve could diſcern the Tears in Pearly-drops glide dovvn her Cheeks. The Goddeſs, ſaid the Prieſt, is not a little moved at ſomething; theſe are deep Prodigies! He had no ſooner ſaid theſe vvords, but her Tears ſeemed to be dried up again; and then ſhe ſmiled in an exceſſive man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: the Lamps alſo vvhich in the time of her vveeping did burn but dimly, vvhen ſhe began to ſmile, gave a more glorious and bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhining light than they had done before! All vvhich things moved a general vvonder in the hearts of us all; and the Prieſt, which vvas likevviſe a little terrified, vvent ſtrait behind the Altar, to underſtand the mind of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs, and coming forth again, vvith a ſtrong and plain Voice he declared her Myſtery, in theſe following vvords:
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:54948:39"/>
                  <q>
                     <p>Oracle.</p>
                     <p>WHen the threatning Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is gone and paſt, and Death hath triumphed over both; till then, and not before, your Loves ſhall plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing be to us; and a Shepher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs ſhall be thought worthy of a Crown.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>After this had been ſaid, vve left the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to return homevvards; both of us very much confuſed at vvhat vve had ſeen, and heard; and the more, becauſe it promiſed us no happineſs till death: We continued ſtill vvalking till vve came to ſome Trees, under vvhoſe cooler ſhades vve deſigned to ſit avvhile for our refreſhment, though vve ſoon found it to coſt us dear; for vve vvere ſcarce ſet dovvn, but vve ſavv our ſelves environed vvith five or ſix men, vvhoſe hideous poſtures, and outragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:54948:40"/>vvords, gave us not the leaſt hopes of eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping from them. They vvere Armed vvith long Cimeters, and large ſtreight Bucklers; and they had every one by his ſide a ſhort Dagger. But vvhether they had met vvith no Prey late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at Sea, (for they came as from thence) to be ſo deſperate as to land, and ſeek ſome on the Shore of this Iſle, a thing never knovvn before; or vvhether it vvas their nature that rendred them thus furious, nothing can be imagined to appear more barbarous than their grim looks: ſparks of fire ſeemed to iſſue from their eyes; and the rage vvith vvhich they fell upon us raiſed ſuch fear in the Heart of <hi>Melliſſa,</hi> that ſhe ſvvooned avvay; and I vvas in the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of either loſing my life, or generouſly preſerving it by contemning of death. I vvould have been content to have fallen into their hands alive, if <hi>Melliſſa</hi> might but eſcape. I put my ſelf then into a poſture of Defence, and preſented my ſelf before theſe Inhumane Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, vvith my Svvord in my hand; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king uſe of all vvhat either Art or Nature had given me of Perfection and Agility, I throwed my ſelf among the midſt of my Enemies, giving ſome Blows, and receiving others, and made a ſign to <hi>Melliſſa</hi> to take her flight while oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity preſented. Three of them I had no ſooner diſpatched, but I ſaw ſix more coming toward us, three of which ſeeing <hi>Melliſſa</hi> endeavour to eſcape, run after her, and the reſt came up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me; I put my ſelf in a poſture to receive them, but they came upon me ſo ſtrongly, and I
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:54948:40"/>being already almoſt ſpent vvith the length of my Combat, that I vvas conſtrained to give way to force. I deſired them, that if they had not altogether baniſhed Humanity from among them, that they would treat my Siſter (meaning <hi>Melliſſa</hi>) with Civility; and if you have any deſign upon my life, let her that fled live by my death. The confuſed language of theſe Villains, and the anger which they bore on their Faces, made me loſe the hope of ever ſoftning their hearts: they bound us together, and loading us with chains of Iron, they blinded our eyes, and puſhed us before them with all the rigor imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, till we came to the Sea-ſide; where ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Boat in readineſs for them, in it we were thrown, and carried on Board of a Ship that lay ſcouting upon the Coaſts for their return. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on Board, they unblinded our eyes, and put us into the Hold; we had not ſailed above four days and nights before they blinded us again, and carried us on Shoar: where I underſtood by a great noiſe when we landed, a whole Troop lay ready to attend them: they ſet us Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, our (eyes being ſtill blinded) and carried us, as we underſtood afterwards, upon the ſide of <hi>Mount Taurus;</hi> where, unblinding us again, they dragged us into an obſcure Cave, under the hollow of the Mountains, where they faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned us in two divers places, to the end we ſhould have no diſcourſe one with another. It is impoſſible to expreſs the complaints and mournings with which we filled the black dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of this Cavern. We had no other hopes
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:54948:41"/>but to ſerve as Victims to the moſt cruel and ungoverned People in the World. About mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, when the whole Fabrick of Nature ſeem'd to ſleep, and the Stars themſelves, the Centuries of Heaven, were covered with gloomy Clouds, as it were to take their reſt; one of the moſt Eminent of thoſe that had brought us into this place, removed a great Stone that was at the mouth of the Cave, and with a Torch in his hand entred, and ſpoke to me in this ſort;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whatſoever thou art,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>it ſhall be made appear in this very moment, that I dwell in the World to do thoſe People a pleaſure whoſe Merits may claim it: You doubt not but you are in the Cuſtody of the moſt Barbarous Company that ever was under Heaven; there is but one way then left for you to ſave your life, which you muſt quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſolve on, or to morrow will be the day of your death. That Young Virgin whom you call your Siſter, and who as taken with you, hath ſo Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med me with her Beauty, that it hath been impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for me ever ſince I firſt ſaw her, to find a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Repoſe: I muſt either be delivered from this amorous Paſſion by my death, or I muſt enjoy her. If thou wilt condeſcend to the laſt, and that I may do it by her conſent, I will grant thee all ſorts of Favours in theſe deſolate places, and will make thee Captain of our Band.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ah Sir! replied I, what do you tell me? bring me rather the ſentence of my death, than to let me hear this diſmal News; I am capable of paying a ſufficient Ranſom for my Liberty, but I will ſooner leave my Life, than my Siſter
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:54948:41"/>in your hands; our Fortunes are too nearly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſed together, to forſake one another at the firſt ſhock: and if death triumphs over one, the other muſt needs periſh. <hi>Melliſſa</hi> (who was at the other end of the Cave) heard the laſt words I pronounced; and by the raiſing of my Voice, ſhe perceived that I began to ſpeak angerly to the Tyrant, which made her not know what to reſolve upon.</p>
               <p>He nevertheleſs ſtill perſiſted to importune me, and by his promiſes to endeavor to corrupt me, and make me a Companion in his Crime. But ſeeing it was all ineffectual, he gave me a great Blow with his Cimeter on my ſhoulder, and had he not ſtruck the Chain with which I was faſtned, and with the weight of the Blow broke it, I never could have removed out of the place. This Blow ſtunn'd me ſo, that I fell down; and becauſe I feared he would redouble it, I feign'd my ſelf dead; whereupon he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly left me, believing me to be as I ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and went ſtrait where <hi>Melliſſa</hi> was; before whom he fell on his knees, conjuring her with all he was able to feign of humility and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to have pitty on a poor Lover, whoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire was to ſave her life, and that he was not come to offer her any violence; but rather by a contraction of friendſhip with her, to deliver her from that danger, which otherwiſe ſhe muſt neceſſarily fall into.</p>
               <p>This Lamentable Virgin not hearing me ſpeak any more, (as being perſwaded that I was mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered,) wept, complained, and ſought all the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:54948:42"/>means ſhe could to bereve her ſelf of life, rather than to ſuffer the Tyrant to approach her. What, ſaid ſhe, Inhuman Villain! hait thou the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (after thou haſt killed my Brother) to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune me with thy ſhameful Addrſſes! No, no, my life is in your power, you may ſtrike boldly, and you ſhall be requited with thanks for it. What, does a too-late repentance ſeize you? hath compaſſion found out an habitation it never had before, that you ſtand thus, and dare not ſtrike? Come, give me the Dagger, and let me execute with my own hands, what thy cruelty does not refuſe me. Ye Gods! what an apprehenſion was I in then? when I heard her pronounce theſe words, I had no more the knowledg of my ſelf! the confuſion and horror of thoſe dark-dwellings had ſo poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed my heart, that I had forgot I was that <hi>Agenoris</hi> that lived once in <hi>Cyprus.</hi> Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, when I heard her pittiful Cries, I rouz'd, as from a profound ſleep, and endeavoured to arm my hands with Stones to caſt at this <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clops,</hi> but I perceived I was faſtned on the left-leg with another Chain; inſomuch that I thought deſpair would have made me run mad. The Villain told her, ſeeing he could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, that ſince death would be ſo ſingular a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to her, in that ſhe ſhould not be humour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but however ſhe ſhould be taught to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to his deſire: and ſtrait lays hold of her, and drags her by her delicate diſhevelled Locks, with her eyes bathed in Tears; and whether the place imprinted in him ſomething of horror,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:54948:42"/>or whether he found a ſurprizal in the act he would not ſtain that obſcure dwelling with a double Crime; (for he thought he had killed me) but with many rude Blows drove her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him! I, who found one of my Feet faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, thereby not being in a capacity to fight, and defend my ſelf, nor to uſe my endeavors to get at liberty, I laid my ſelf down, to the end he might think me dead: but it was an exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive trouble to <hi>Melliſſa</hi> when ſhe ſaw me lie in that poſture; and not being able to conquer her anguiſh, ſhe fell down; and I believed ſhe had died with ſorrow, if the Gods had not miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly preſerved her! at length by little and little ſhe got up, and, in riſing, ſaid ſhe, At leaſt, Infamous Viper, give me leave to beſtow one Kiſs on the cold Lips of him you have killed; and though he be dead, let me whiſper my laſt Farewel in his Ear! the favour is but ſmall I ask of you, and nevertheleſs it ſhall be an obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation I'll owe to thy Cruelty, (if it be poſſible to oblige ſuch a Perſon.) No, no, replied this Monſter, this is no time to interrupt my deſign; you muſt go with me to learn what Hatred can do, where Love could find no place. In ſaying theſe words, he dragged her out by her dainty Hair, (too too precious for ſuch cruel touches;) and the Torch that had lighted them to the moſt retired part of the Cave, went out it ſelf, as if it had been aſhamed to give light to an act ſo wicked and deteſtable as he was now going about. I continued cold, as if all my veins were filld with Ice! and whoever had
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:54948:43"/>ſeen me then, would truly have judged that there was little difference between my face and that of a dead mans: The horror to ſee <hi>Melliſſa</hi> raviſhed away in this manner, without my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to help her, or run after her, and the darkneſs of the place in which I was, all alone, depriving me of the uſe of my ſenſs, I fell down once more, not being able to breath ſighs to eaſe me, nor words to mourn out my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſter. The ſilence and darkneſs of th night feemed to favour the deſign of him that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away <hi>Melliſſa,</hi> and the Stars ſeemed aſhamed at ſo much violence! for the whole Region of Air, were the thick and obſcure clothing of Clouds, and added another night to the very night it ſelf! Sometimes I could hear the grievous Cries of this miſerable Fair-One, and could diſtinguiſh ſome of her words from among the threatnings of the Tyrant that thus handled her! Inſomuch, that as many times as I heard her Shrieks, as many ſharp Daggers did I feel, that ſeemed to pierce my very heart! In vain did I try to break to Chain that held me, to follow and help her; for I had no Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to make uſe of to unlooſen me; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the horrors of Darkneſs were ſo great, that I knew not what art to uſe to find a way out; deſpair was all the remedy I found! and I prepared my ſelf to endure all the calamities that Fortune was capable of laying upon me. Nevertheleſs, as I was knocking my ſlf againſt the Wall, and ſeeking all the means I could to bereave my ſelf of Life; one of the Chains
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:54948:43"/>by which I was faſtned, looſned; which having perceived, I took up the firſt Stone I could find at my Feet, and began to knock with it upon the Irons, with ſuch force, that at length I found a way to diſengage my ſelf throughly; and I preſently endeavoured with my hands to find the way out of the Cave; and after I had wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred about the obſcure turnings of this mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful dwelling, I diſcovered the way out, by which <hi>Melliſſa</hi> was carried, and tried to follow her foot-ſteps. But although the bright Rayes of the Sun darted themſelves from the <hi>Orient,</hi> and diſcovered me the way, and the place where I was; the fear nevertheleſs that ſeized me, not knowing which way to go, put me into a greater confuſion than before: however, I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the firſt tract my inſtinct inſpired me with, and croſſed ſhady Woods, and fertil Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys, but not knowing where to ſeek <hi>Melliſſa!</hi> I ſought her in all places where my paſſion di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected me: Sometimes would I call her, but could not hear of her, unleſs it were by the repetition of her Name, by ſome neighbouring Eccho, which did but renew my ſorrow; and the farther I went, the leſs I heard of her. At length I ſought another path, to ſee whether Fortune would be more ſavourable: but into whatſoever place of Solitude I went, and whatever Deſert I paſſed, I ſaw nothing but the image of night, and ſilence. After I had long wandred in this manner, I entred into a ſmall Wood, not far from the Cave out of which I came; where the firſt thing that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:54948:44"/>it ſelf to my view, was the dead Corps of him that had carried away <hi>Melliſſa,</hi> which lay ſtretched on the ground, wounded in three ſeveral places; his arms were ſcattered in divers parts hard by, and the very graſs was red with his Blood. I conſidered this Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle as an action indifferent; but when I took more particular notice of his Face, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by came to know who it was, I ſtood ſo aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed and confuſed, as if I had been ſuddenly ſtruck with thunder. Gods! ſaid I to my ſelf, what ſtrange Reincounter is this? here is the Raviſher, but where is ſhe that is Raviſhed? whre was <hi>Melliſſa</hi> during this Combat? can this man be dead, and ſhe alive? In ſaying this, I looked round about me, to conſider whether it might be poſſible for me to diſcover the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of this accident: As I was thus contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plating this diſaſter, I perceived in a little Buſh that was very thick, a ſmall Box covered with a piece of white linnen; curioſity made me approach nearer to it, that I might take a more full view of it, and, to my great misfortune, I found that it was the little Box of Jewels I had preſented to <hi>Melliſſa</hi> a little after my depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from thence: and then fear had ſo poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed my ſenſes, that I was even ready every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to expire; for it made me infallibly judg that ſhe was murthered. I took them both up, and kiſſed them with many unfeigned kiſſes; and breathing a long and hearty ſigh, why am I not permitted, ſaid I, Bright <hi>Melliſſa!</hi> to know where this Inhuman Tyger hath caſt thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:54948:44"/>Body? to the end I may render thee the laſt <hi>Devoir</hi> a Lover is capable of manifeſting to her he loves: and that I may Erect a Tomb over it in theſe ſilent Deſerts, on which each minute I will drop a mournful Tear; and the laſt drops ſhall be my ſelf into thy Grave, that one Sepulchre may ſerve us both. But alas! in vain! in vain do I thus moan! ſince what I mourn for, is not to be found. Yea Divinities! who bear Rule both in Heaven, and upon Earth; are ye inſenſible at ſuch cruel Injuſtice? have you no Thunderbolts left to revenge this barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Act? you have executed a part of your Vengeance; but the ſame Weapon that killed her, muſt kill me: I could die to have <hi>Melliſſa</hi> living; but I cannot live aftr her death. Then rturning towards the dead Carcaſs, and arming my hands with his Sword, It is thou, perfideous Tyrant, ſaid I, that hath raviſhed from me this precious Treaſure, and that hath thus miſerably maſſacred her! had thy cruelty ſuch power over thy barbarous heart, as to deprive her of life that gave it to others! and to ſnatch the light from thoſe ſparkling eyes, whoſe ſplendor could once invert the courſe of Nature, by forcing day to appear in the very midſt of night and darkneſs! whereby the Earth could boaſt ſhe had her Sun, as well as the Heavens! But what do I ſay? I defer my death too long; the ſame Weapon muſt pierce the Body of <hi>Age<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noris,</hi> that took away the life of <hi>Melliſſa:</hi> and would to the Gods, that he that did it, had yet ſome ſign of life, that he might feel the effects
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:54948:45"/>of my juſt revenge; and that his own Arms might expiate his Crime.</p>
               <p>In ſaying this, I ſaw three men covered with the skins of Bears and Lions, armed with very long and broad Cimeters; who having heard the noiſe of my Complaints, without compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending the Subject, flew upon me ſo, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving only time to ſhut the Box I had found, I drew my Sword, and defended my ſelf with what dexterity and courage I could, againſt their blows, (for the deſire I had to die, depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved me from fearing any danger I might meet with.) But when they knew him that lay at my feet, and had ſeen that it was their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; after they had ſent forth a Cry, capable to make the very Heavens tremble, and fright the very Gods themſelves! their Eyes flaming with choler, and their Faces covered with blood! they came upon me with ſuch force, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving deprived me of my Sword, one of them was going to cleave down my head with his Cimeter; if the other, who came to him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the blow with his hand had not prevented him, by telling him that they muſt make an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary revenge of my Crime, and that a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon death would not be ſufficient to content the Ghoſt of <hi>Cleobulus,</hi> (for ſo was the Name of this cruel Tyrant.) They preſently fettered me with Irons; and whilſt two of them carried away the dead Body, the other drove me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them. It availed m not to call the Gods to witneſs of my innocence! and to ſwear to them by what was moſt holy in the Heavens
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:54948:45"/>that I was not culpable; but what greater proof could they have, than to find me by the dead Body, armed with his own Sword, and in a poſture of giving him an hundred wounds more, had there appeared any ſign of Life in him? The affliction they had on one ſide, for the death of their Maſter; and the joy they had on the other, for a prize ſo important, ſoon gathered them companions; for I ſaw them come round me as from all parts, like ſo many Wolves to devour me; for my part, I knew not how I was; for whereſoever I turned my eyes, although the preſent danger might have given me ſome apprehenſion, the memory of <hi>Melliſſa</hi>'s diſaſter left no room in me to deplore my own misfortune. If thoſe that led me, had but taken notice of my Tears, it was not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that their Rage could have continued; for it ſeemed as though the Heavens, the Woods, and all things that Nature had made inſenſible, had compaſſion on me! the Heavens were ſad, and diſtilled themſelves in tears; the Air and Earth ſounded with my ſighs, and the Valleys through which I paſſed, with my complaints! Nevertheleſs, the further we advanced in our way, the greater was the inſolence of thoſt Villains; till having perceived the Walls of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronia,</hi> the principal City of their Retreat, where there is a Magazin of Arms, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable quantity of all ſorts of Robbers, whoſe power is equal to that of thoſe Kings and Princes that border upon them. Preſently there came out to meet us above five hundred
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:54948:46"/>men in Arms, as if they would conduct me in triumph; for they believed there was ſome of their Enemies, according to the report that was ſpread abroad, that an Army was coming againſt them: Scarce was I got into the middle of their Crew, but I found my ſelf ſaluted with new reproaches, eſpecially when they expoſed the Body of <hi>Cleobulus</hi> to the view of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick; for his Wife, who was in the Town, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing advertized of his pretended Murder, breaks thorow the Guards, and tears me from the hand of him that held me faſt. What, ſays ſhe, is this the man that deprived me of a Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band? and the Town of <hi>Latronia</hi> of a Captain? his death ſhall be dearly bought; for I my ſelf will be the Executioner. I'll take away his life, and tear him in a thouſand pieces! She had ſcarce ended thoſe words, when ſhe fell upon me, and threw me down, imprinting the fury of her nails and anger in my Face. But thoſe who had taken me, ſeeing that this <hi>Megara</hi> continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to perſecute me in that manner, and for fear the little life I had remaining, might not ſerve to ſuſtain that vengeance and cruelty to which I was deſtined; took me from her, put me in Priſon, conſulting in the mean time what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of torment I was to ſuffer, (for there is no manner of Juſtice in this Town:) and when they take any ſtranger, they conſider not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves whether he ought to die or no, but what ſort of death muſt make an end of him. About eleven of the Clock at night, that being the time they make their Sacrifices,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:54948:46"/>becauſe the Adoration they paid, was to the Infernal Gods; ſuch as <hi>Pluto, Proſerpine,</hi> with the Furies themſelves: about that time, I ſay, a general noiſe was heard all over the Town, and the Streets were filled in an inſtant with lighted Torches: for ſoon after our arrival, the Wife of <hi>Cleobulus</hi> was making preparation for the Interment of her Husband, whoſe Body lay in the Temple of <hi>Proſerpine,</hi> till they could Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry him in the Sepulchre of his Anceſtors, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Cuſtom; inſomuch that the Prieſts of the Goddeſs judging that it was time to depart, ſent to give notice to the Chiefeſt of <hi>Latronia</hi> to aſſiſt at his Burial; they had in the mean time concluded that I ſhould be burned alive for the Murder I was accuſd of. At the ſame moment, being weary with the hardſhip I endured the precedent day and night, I began (notwithſtanding all the apprehenſions that troubled my mind) to take ſome repoſe; when two men came in, and clothing me in a black Robe, commanded me to follow them.</p>
               <p>This Ceremony at firſt ſeemed ſtrange to me, for I knew nothing yet concerning what they had determined againſt me in Councel; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs I put on this mourning Robe; and after they had faſthed me in Irons of the ſame co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, they conducted me to the Temple, where the people were all ready aſſembled in Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Habits, having every one in his hand a Torch: I was no ſooner come, but all the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Pomp marched in order: I brought up the Rear, being covered with Chains, and guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:54948:47"/>with the greateſt part of the Army; we went about half a mile from the Town, and entred into a ſpacious Field, where the Citizens of <hi>Latronia</hi> were accuſtomed to be Buried. The Prieſts having opened the Tomb, ſtood up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a piece of ground ſomething higher than the reſt, and began to read the Sentence of my Death, much to this effect:</p>
               <p>That for the Murder committed on the perſon of <hi>Cleobulus,</hi> I was condemned to be burned alive, before the place of the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, and my Aſhes to be caſt into the Wind, that the memory of my Name might be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipated with the reſt of my Body. I was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſtartled at this pitiful Sentence; neither was I concerned at the manner of my death, for death was a thing could never ſtrike ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror in me; I had a Soul far greater than my misfortunes. Caſting my eye upon the ſtake where I was to be conſumed, I conſidered it as a place where I ſhould enjoy that I deſired, and as my only road to the all-plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing <hi>Elizinm;</hi> when I alſo conſidered in my ſelf, that <hi>Melliſſa</hi> was dead, and that to live longer was to conſume my life away in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual anguiſh, I mattered not to dye; and it ſeemed as though the Flames of Love, which are divine, would render the matrial leſs ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. Whilſt I was about meditating what I had beſt to do, and as my mind was imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on other things than to ſearch out arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices to deliver me from a danger that was ſo near; they buried <hi>Cleobulus</hi> in the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:54948:47"/>of his Anceſtors, and all the people throng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about the ſtake to ſee me burned; in the ſame inſtant the Prieſts made me mount upon the pile of Wood. When I ſaw my ſelf in that pitiful condition; (the Wife of <hi>Cleobulus</hi> holding a Torch in her hand to put Fire to the Wood) I could not forbear to mourn out my diſaſter in theſe words; <hi>Agenoris,</hi> mourn the day that ever thou didſt ſee <hi>Melliſſa;</hi> for there, there was the beginning of thy diſaſter; but alas what do I ſay fair <hi>Melliſſa?</hi> pardon theſe words, cauſed by an exceſs of my grief; and if yet thou haſt any thing of life remaining, or if old <hi>Charon,</hi> concerned at my miſery, will cauſe his Boat to ſtay, go not alone to the <hi>Elizian</hi> Shades, let my Soul accompany thee, and as Love united our Hearts, ſo now let Death reunite our Souls.</p>
               <p>Whilſt I was breathing forth theſe words towards the Heavens, they that led me faſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me with Cords, which was no ſooner done, but the Wife of <hi>Cleobulus</hi> ſet fire to the Wood, which was preſently in a flame, the Smoak having almoſt choaked me, not ſo much as giving me the leaſure to brathe, and my Senſes failed me; and what could fortune have done more to me, than to cauſe me to be faſtened to a ſtake in that manner, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be ſwallowed up by the Flames among the moſt deteſtable Crew that live under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Could l be in a mor miſerable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and nevertheleſs you ſhall hear how the Gods would not ſuffer my innocency to be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:54948:48"/>and how they do not begin to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour Mortals before all other helps fail: Know then, that this Troop of Robbers and Pyrats increaſd in Proceſs of tim by a number of Vagabonds, Slaves, and Fugitives, who ſeeing they could not live under the ſeverity of the Laws of the Prince of <hi>Cappadocia</hi> and other Neighbouring Provinces, had taken refuge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Mount <hi>Taurus,</hi> as in an approved Fortreſs, where they might defend themſelves againſt the Incurſions and Power of their Enemies; the King of <hi>Lasonia;</hi> as moſt intereſſed in this affair, and being the neareſt Neighbour to theſe Robbers, had often endeavoured to put them all to the Sword; ut this Mountain was ſo ſtrong, and the approaches of their <hi>Latronia</hi> ſo difficult, that it was impoſſible for them to overcome them, for <hi>Cleobulus</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted them to commit all manner of crimes, and there was no wickedneſs under Heaven but found a recompence among them. No body dare come near them; they would come in Arms even to the adjoyning Frontiers, and would ſometimes take and deſtroy whole Towns, as I have ſince underſtood: but <hi>Cleobu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> was the cauſe of their general Defeat; for <hi>Polecrates</hi> King of the <hi>Piſidians</hi> having a little before ſent his Son againſt this Rabble, with an Army of eight thouſand men for to rout them: He ingaging his Perſon a little too far in the Combat, was killed by the hand of <hi>Clobulus</hi> himſelf, and all his Troops cut to pieces: <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> juſtly concerned at ſuch a loſs, conjured
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:54948:48"/>all his Allies, and begged of them to ſuccour him againſt thoſe barbarous villains, ſo that in a little time there was an Army of 25000 men raiſed for the Enterprize.</p>
               <p>In ſo much that as it pleaſeth the Gods to bring all things to the point to which they are deſtined, King <hi>Polycrates</hi> having brought his Troops to the top of Mount <hi>Taurus,</hi> that ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth all <hi>Aſia,</hi> it was even a wonder, for contrary to the Opinion of the moſt prudent men, his Van-guard was at the Gates of <hi>Latronia</hi> at the ſame time that I was going to be conſumed, a Confuſion flies preſently into the middle of the Aſſembly, and fear having ſcattered them into all places, the Enemy entered pelmell into the Town, and ſeized upon the Gates. The Wife of <hi>Cleobulus,</hi> who yet held the Torch in her hand to ſet fire to thoſe parts of the Wood, that were not yet lighted, was one of the firſt that left the Sacrifice and ran away. I knew not what to think of this new Accident, and believed that Fortune, not being ſatisfied to ſee my Body re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to Aſhes, prepared a more cruel Death for me. But contrary to my exprectation, Captain <hi>Dyoniſius,</hi> Son to the great Prieſt, who command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this Van-guard, perceiving m in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, ready to give up the Ghoſt, and half ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled with the Smoak, whether it was not of pitty, or whether he would reſerve me for a greater pain, cauſed me to be taken down; I rendered him thanks for the favour he did me, and told him briefly the Reaſons why they intended to ſacrifice me, that truly I had not killed <hi>Cleobulus</hi>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:54948:49"/>as they all imagined; but that if he had not been dead when I ſaw him in the Wood, no body had more reaſon to kill him then I had. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the reſt of the Diſcourſe for another time, for he was too buſie, and too eager in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of the Enemies. He put me then to be guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d by one of his own men, and turns his Troops againſt th Inhabitants of <hi>Latronia,</hi> who ſtill continued to make a reſiſtance, and who were got into the Fortreſs that was in the Town: in the mean time the whole body of the Army fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, which came pouring upon theſe bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous wretches, turned their Town topſey tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey, and fired it in all parts, to the end, that in the deepeſt darkneſs of the Night their very houſes might ſerve them, as Torches, to Maſſacre them: the Streets were filled with nothing but dead Bodies, and bleeding Carcaſſes; never was the Alarm ſo furious in the Town of <hi>Troy,</hi> when the <hi>Greeks</hi> reveng'd the injury done to <hi>Hellin,</hi> for wherever you turned your eyes, you could ſee nothing but Blood and Death. But pray obſerve the extent of Choler, when it hath got the ſole government over Reaſon and the reſt of the Paſſions; Some Soldiers of <hi>Dyoniſius</hi> his Army coming luckily to know that <hi>Cleobulus</hi> was newly buryed, they ſurrounded his Tomb, with hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible noiſes and out-crys, as if they would pull his very ſoul out of Hell, to make him ſuffer that pain which they would inflict upon his inſenſible Body, taking him then out of his Coffin, they tore his winding-Sheet in a thouſand pieces: and after they had cut off all the parts apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:54948:49"/>thereunto, the Noſe, Ears, Fingers, and all other Members, they run him in a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred times with their Swords and Halberts; and upon the firſt approach of day light, they carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him before the Fortreſs, where they faſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to a Gibbet that he himſelf had built not for Criminals, for they remained all unpuniſhed; but for thoſe that commit not Robberies and wickedneſs enough: then thy cut him in five or ſix pieces, and for Trophy of their Victory, dragged him along the Streets, with all the Calumnies and Indignities that the unbridled Multitude are capable to invent, if one can commit any Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to ſuch a noted Rogue. His Wife who had taken ſhelter in the Fortreſs with the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent perſons of <hi>Latronia,</hi> could not ſee this Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle without teſtifying her reſentment; ſhe tore her Hair, and made her Face ſwell with Blood; and after ſhe had vomited an infinity of Blaſphemies and injuries againſt Heaven, and againſt <hi>Dyonſius,</hi> ſhe went to the top of all the principal Tower, and caſt her ſelf down; all the place was covered with her Brains, and with thick lumps of Blood that came out of her Head. After that the Town of <hi>Latronia</hi> was ſacked, and that there was nothing of their Fortreſſes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining but a ſmoaky Vapour and thick Cloud that roſe from the burning of the Houſes, part of the Army went to Mount <hi>Taurus,</hi> to exterminate the remainder of theſe Vagabonds; and the reſt returned to their firſt Quarters, under the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of <hi>Dyoniſius,</hi> who ſeemed to have a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar care of my life, he cauſEd a Chamber to be
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:54948:50"/>provided for me juſt over his, and becauſe the laſt nights labour had wearyed me, I caſt my ſelf down upon a Bed, to take ſome reſt, but juſt as ſleep was going to ſteal upon me, I heard a faint Voice, like complaining in the next Chamber, which ſeemed to accuſe the Stars, for having conſpired to make them unhappy; <hi>Ought thou, O Love,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>to deprive me in a moment of my Lovers preſence? where art thou, dear hope of my Life? if my Fate was ſo cruel to me, as to create me too low in Birth, to make me not preſume to think of becoming thy Bride, if I did not promiſe to render thee and me happy, yet methinks thy preſnce, thy dear preſence! will give me that ſatisfaction, I am now deſtitute off: that I love thee tenderly, let Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven witneſs, but it was a Love ſo pure, that thy ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry preſence did ſeem to give bounds to my deſires; if I loved thee, I loved thy ſight and company; what un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy influence hath thus ſeparated us? The whole Army of</hi> Dyoniſius <hi>tryumphs over the defeat of</hi> Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulus, <hi>but I amongſt all theſe Joyes muſt wear mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to deplore thy Misfortune: O lamentable Trophy's, and melancholy Spoils! But ſince I have no other hope remaining, I'l bereave my ſelf of this wretched Life, to accompany the ſilent ſhadow of my</hi> Agenoris.</p>
               <p>At theſe words, an univerſal confuſion ſeized upon my ſences; I knew it was <hi>Melliſſa</hi>'s Voice, but yet the ſound of it was ſo faint and weak, that I could think it to be no other thing but her Ghoſt, that called me to come where ſhe was.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pardon me,</hi> ſaid I, <hi>(then bright ſoul) if I have ſo long delayed to follow thee, I have ſought all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions to ſacrifice my life for the expiation of the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:54948:50"/>Crime which I have committed in unhappily conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thee from thy innocent Flocks: but however, my own hands ſhall puniſh me, and make thee an Offering of my Life, for a certain aſſurance of that ſincere Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection I bear thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Scarce had I ended theſe words, but there was a great noiſe in the Chamber from whence the Voice came. I gave attention to this Buſle, for amidſt the conſuſion of words, I heard a claſhing of Arms, which made me belive that ſome body was raviſhing away <hi>Melliſſa</hi> again. At length whether ſhe heard my Complaint, or whether ſhe knew my Voice, I heard her bid me <hi>Adieu,</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>She would remember her Vows,</hi> and likewiſe intreated m to retain ſome remmbrance of her; then I felt a freſh aſſault upon my Heart, and as if a cold Ice were melted in all my Veins, it was incompaſſed with a general apprehenſion; I roſe from my Bed, looked out at the Window, and in the obſcurity of the Night, amongſt the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Torches, I deſcerned four of thoſe Soldiers that I had ſeen to follow <hi>Dyoniſius,</hi> that were carrying away this miſerable Virgin: Gods! what tears and ſighs did I then ſpend to ſee thoſe fair Eyes again eclipſed from my preſence? the remainder of the Night ſeemed a whole Age to me, and if the Day had not reſtored that Light to the World, which the Night had taken from it, I had thought to my ſelf to have been no other than a ſhadow, I inquired of thoſe that were near <hi>Dyoniſius,</hi> what Maid that was, that they carryed away in the Night? all the anſwer I could receive was, That ſhe had been taken
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:54948:51"/>away by force from five or ſix Soldiers, that had left their Colours to do miſchief in the Fields and Roads; and that they were now conducting her to <hi>Piſidia,</hi> there to be ſacrificed to the Gods, becauſe of the Victory that King <hi>Arcon</hi> had newly obtained over his Enemies.</p>
               <p>This News loaded me with a new grief, for now I doubted not but it was <hi>Melliſſa,</hi> for having heard the complaints ſhe made, and having ſeen ſo many particulars, but dare not to diſcover my ſelf, for fear of engendring ſome kind of ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the mind of <hi>Dyonifius.</hi> I often did endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to eſcape from the Army, to follow her I loved, but I was guarded ſo cloſely, that all my Enterprizes were unprofitable: and in find, I had intelligence, from a Slave, they had a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign upon my Life; and that all the kindneſs I dayly received from <hi>Dyoniſius</hi> tended to no other end, but to render me the more agreeable to the Gods. I began then to be ſad, and to change my form of Life; I was not ſorry to dye, but I was troubled that the Army tarryed ſo long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it returned, leſt <hi>Melliſſa</hi> were ſacrificed in <hi>Piſidia,</hi> before I might enjoy the happineſs of ſeeing her. In fine, we were carryed to the City of <hi>Antioch,</hi> where the King, after he had recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced his Captains, and divided the Spoil that he had taken in <hi>Latronia,</hi> disbanded his Army, and returned in Triumph to his Pallace, where the Queen expected him. The Father of <hi>Dyo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſius</hi> the great Prieſt came to him, to let him know, That after ſo glorious a Victory, he ought to make Sacrifice to the Gods; that the ordinary
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:54948:51"/>Victims not being ſufficient for what the Gods had done for him, the lives of Men were only capable of an acknowledgment of their favours; and ſince what they required ſhould be pure and unpolluted, that it was reaſonable to offer them a Sacrifice of the firſt Spoils that the Army met with in entring <hi>Latronia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dyoniſius,</hi> who was preſent at the Speech, cauſed me to be called, and told King <hi>Arcon,</hi> That he had reſerved me on purpoſe to ſerve for the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctim, becauſe I was the firſt he had met in enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Town; he alſo asked his Father, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he had not received a Maid that he had ſent him? who anſwered,<hi>Yes.</hi> By the Kings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand they began to prepare for the Sacrifice againſt the next Morning: and then I began to hope, if there be any content in hoping for death, that I ſhould ſee <hi>Melliſſa</hi> once again, before I dyed. But the expectation of ſuch a happineſs was ſoon followed with other News much more ſad, for as the King was asking for the Virgin that ſhould be ſacrificed, News was brought, That <hi>Philander,</hi> the younger Brother of <hi>Dyoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius,</hi> and Son to the great Prieſt, was extremely in love with her, and had carryed her away, no body knowing to what part. It is impoſſible to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the grief which I received from theſe words, for I was in the King preſence when this News was brought to him, who took it as an ill Omen, that the Son of his Prieſt ſhould hinder him from rendring the Gods thanks, and preſently cauſed 200 Horſe to be ſent throughout <hi>Piſidia,</hi> to find out where <hi>Philander</hi> was retired; and the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:54948:52"/>was put off to another day. I ſeeing that no News could be heard of <hi>Melliſſa,</hi> and that they intended to put me to Death, did under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand deal with my Keepers, by a ſum of Money, for to get away, for beſides the Box I had found of <hi>Melliſſa</hi>'s, which was very full of rich Jewels, I had much more about me, which I had at the time of my departure from hence; my deſign ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding then, as heart could wiſh, I took my way where my deſign guided me, and perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding my ſelf, that <hi>Philander</hi> was gone towards <hi>Caria,</hi> becauſe that thoſe the King ſent after him had taken that way, in a diſguiſe, that they might not know me again, I followed them at a diſtance, but I was not got fifty Miles from <hi>Antioch,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Courier from the King came to give no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that the Sacrifice was done, and that it was not neceſſary for them to go any further. Then was I in new apprehenſions, I knew not whether I had beſt return back again to <hi>Dioni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius,</hi> and preſent my ſelf a Victim, or go into <hi>Caria,</hi> where I had ſome acquaintance. The death of <hi>Melliſſa</hi> bereft me of any deſire I might have to ſurvive her; and when I ſaw that they were not permitted to go any further, I eaſily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that ſhe was found, and that King <hi>Arcon</hi> had ſacrificed her to the Gods; Can any one concevie themſelves to be more miſerable than I? When I reflected upon all theſe croſs accidents, truly I then believed that Fortune had done all ſhe could to me.</p>
               <p>I went into <hi>Caria</hi> and came into the Town <hi>Heracleus</hi> near <hi>Latmos,</hi> where Reigneth the King
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:54948:52"/>
                  <hi>Polidor,</hi> I continued in that Court for ſometime, where my friends were troubled to ſee ſo much grief in my countenance; The Price was very civil to me, and would make me uſe all manner of Diverſions, to endeavor to drive away my Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, ſometimes would be carry me to hunt upon Mount <hi>Latmos,</hi> but nothing could diſſipate that Melancholly that conſumed me. In fine, after I had took my leave of this Prince, and returned him thanks anſwerable to the favors I had received of him, I had a deſire to return and end my days here in <hi>Cyprus,</hi> I embarked at the Haven <hi>Mileta</hi> and ſailed by the Iſle of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> but it was but to render me more miſerable, for I was taken by Pyrates who robbed me of my money, and of the Box I had that belonged to <hi>Melliſſa;</hi> nevertheleſs, as I was faſtened in the Cabben all alone as they were conſulting upon my life, there came two great Veſſels ſailing upon us, and ſtuck ſo cloſely to us, that we were conſtrained to change our Maſter, as if the Gods would puniſh the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice of the firſt by the wickedneſs of the other. This new change filled me with new fears; for wiſhing for nothing more than death, and not being capable of receiving it, it was to dye as often as they gave me hope of life; the Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize of our Veſſel, and all the Priſoners being put into the Ships of the Conquerors, I ſaw the moſt cruel and bloody ſpectacle that fortune could make me ſee, I perceived <hi>Mellliſſa</hi> upon the ſhore of the Iſland of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> on that ſide of it where it advanceth it point into the Ocean, (for we were not very far off from it) who was faſtened
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:54948:53"/>and bound with chains, followed by an infinite number of Corſaryes, and a Prieſt that held in his hand a knife to cut her throat, I could not well ſee her face, for a long vail covered her head, but I knew her cloathes, her port, her Actions, and what I had formerly took notice of in her that was moſt remarkable, the Veſſel wherein I was threw out her Anchor to ſtay and ſee the ceremony, for there was an Altar erected on the ſhore, upon which the Incenſe did already ſmoak, and all preparations were made for the ſacrifice, I took notice of this prodigy a great while. Is it poſſible, ſaid I to my ſelf, that <hi>Melliſſa</hi> is not yet dead? Is that her Ghoſt, or is that which I ſee true? I know her apparel, and if my eyes deceive me not I ſee the very features of her face; O Gods ſaid I, if it be ſo, plunge me in the bottom of the Sea, to the end I may not ſee ſo horrible a maſſacre, the Pilot who ſaw me in thoſe tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſports, not knowing the cauſe of ſuch a ſudden motion, laid hold on me for I was juſt going to caſt my ſelf into the water, for my eyes (alas muſt that word be pronounced) ſaw the knife ſtuck in the throat of that Divine Beauty, I was grieved I could not give her the laſt adieu, nor know the cauſe of this barbarous action; the Captain of our Veſſel ſtraight hoyſted his ſayls, and we were carryed into the main Sea, having no other objects; to behold but Air and Water; I enquired of thoſe that were priſoners with me what ceremony it was we had ſeen uon the ſhore, they anſwered me that all that Country was peopled with nought but vagabonds and
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:54948:53"/>Pyrats, who before they ſailed upon any enter-prize, had a cuſtome to caſt lots amongſt their ſlaves, for which of them ſhould be ſacrificed to the Divinities of the Sea.</p>
               <p>Scarce were we lanched into the Ocean when the riſing of a mighty tempeſt made large foulds upon the waters, and the fury of the wind was ſo great that our Veſſel was ſplit all to pieces, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs as if I could not meet death in the middle of ſo many dangers, I ſaved my ſelf upon a broken table, and meeting as fortune would have it, a ſhip that was ſailing for <hi>Pamphilia,</hi> I got into it, and arrived ſafe at the Haven where the Gods darted on me a ray of their favor, in giving me the knowledg of a Merchant I had once ſeen in <hi>Syria,</hi> when I travelled thither; who after he had favourably received me into his houſe, made me take of him as much money as I would to relieve my train, but I who deſired to have no body with me took up as much mony as I thought would bear my charges to <hi>Cyprus,</hi> when imbark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the firſt ſhip that was bound thither, I happily arrived at <hi>Paphos,</hi> where after I was land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I was about to ſacrifice my life in the Grove of <hi>Venus,</hi> to follow my Dear <hi>Melliſſa,</hi> when you <hi>Theocles</hi> and <hi>Clidamant</hi> did too ſoon prevent me. Pardon me dear ſoul continued he. If I have not rendred thee tat duty, I ought to have done, my life I know is a preſent thou muſt expect, and I ask nothing more of the Gods than a glorious death, that I may bear thee company in the <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zian</hi> ſhades. In ſaying theſe words, the tears trickled down his cheeks like Orient pearls, and
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:54948:54"/>his grief would let him ſay no more; <hi>Clidamant</hi> acknowledged love to be very powerful when he is maſter of all the other paſſions, of which opinion they were all, and ſaid whatſoever they were able, to comfort him and give him hopes of a better fortune for the time to come; it now begininng to grow late, they all but <hi>Clidamant</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted the room; who knows (ſaid <hi>Clidamant</hi> to him when the reſt were gone) but the Gods expreſly cauſed <hi>Melliſſa</hi> to dye, to make you the happier man hereafter, an to the end, that a Prince of your greatneſs ſhould not debaſe his bloud and parts, by eſpouſing one that was ſo much beneath him, a poor young Shepherddeſs; can ſhe deſerve to be the bride of a private Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, if ſhe cannot, much leſs can ſhe to be a Queen. I much confeſs, fair ſhe is, and fair enough to be beloved by you, but not to be dignified with Royalty. Hold theſe balſphemies, ſaid <hi>Agno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> except you would make me eſteem you for ever as my enemy; I am a Prince it is true, but where is my Kingdom, I have only the name remaining, and for <hi>Melliſſa</hi> had I not ſeen ſomething in her face and behaviour that was extraordinary, had I not ſeem ſomething in her that diſtinguiſhed her from other people of her condition, which made me almoſt ſuſpect that ſhe was beyond what ſhe ſeemed to be; And had I not ſeen thoſe perfections that dwelt in her pretty face, and thoſe eyes whoſe ſparkling luſtre were capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of making the ſtrongeſt man to yield, (but alas ſhe is now no more to be ſeen, her eyes are cloſed, her roſey cheeks have loſt their

                  <hi>I muſt confeſs,</hi> ſaid <hi>Clidamant, I have my ſelf ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired at many things in her which are not common, and have likewiſe thought, when I have looked ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly upon her, that I ſaw ſomething in her Face that might almoſt make her deſerve you; ſhe had a caſt with her Eye methought, and a look which did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely counterfeit Majeſty; but when I conſidered again that ſhe was no other than a Shepherds Daughter, could not think her a Match for ſo great a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon your ſelf; and I could have wiſhect, that from among all thoſe beautiful Princeſſes that are in</hi> Aſia, <hi>that you had made choice of ſome object more

Times,</hi> ſaid <hi>Agenoris, do not ſo ſuddenly change, and whether they do or no, I am indifferent, for time and fortune have now done all they can do; they have deprived me of my Kingdom, they have made me Spectator of the Death of her I loved, and they have deprived me of the means of obtaining that Death I now deſire; are not theſe Afflictions grievous? are they not intolerable?</hi>

            <p>THe light of the Sun had ſcarce diſſipated the thick miſts of Darkneſs, when moſt of his Illuſtrious Family had left their Beds again: <hi>Theocles</hi> was the firſt to whom the brightneſs of the Morning gave an invitation to walk into the Garden adjoyning to the Houſe; he was ſeconded by a Lady that wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on <hi>Emilia,</hi> whoſe name was <hi>Livia,</hi> and who was the beſt beloved by her Miſtreſs of any of her Attendance; ſhe was carreſſed by one <hi>Theobaldus,</hi> a Servant that waited upon <hi>Theocles,</hi> and to whom ſhe gave little cauſe of deſpair, for her inclination ſeemed to tend much towards him; but he on the contary (as moſt young Lovers do) after they have loved a little while, ſeemed much colder in his purpoſe to her than he was before, which made her think he began to grow weary of loving her, and that loving Novelty better, he
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:54948:56"/>had made choice of a new object, to beſtow there what he had taken from her. This, as we muſt needs think, raiſed ſome diſturbance in her mind, which made her, at that time, deſire to be pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, that ſhe might conſult her thoughts with more leiſure in what ſhe had beſt to do. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhe had ſet her ſelf down then in the midſt of the Garden, by the ſide of a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, where her Eyes were fixed upon the ſpouting of the Water out of a Dolphins mouth, upon which, by the reflection of the Sun, from its cleerneſs as it came forth, might be diſcovered a perfect Rain-bow, with all thoſe colours as are to be ſeen in the heavenly one. After ſhe had ſpent ſome of her thoughts in this delightful place, ſhe walked from thence through a middle Walk that led her under a cloſe and freſh Arbour, which was above in a Terras walk, it was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry private and ſolitary, and the Terras walk is ſeparated from the place wherein ſhe was by a thick Hedge, cut on the top ſmooth, and like a ſquare, about the middle of which, towards the other end of the Garden, are ſix ſtone Steps, whereby you aſcend up into the Walk, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly at the other end is another Arbour, made after the ſame manner as this; ſhe ſtayed there not long but ſomething imployed her mind other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, for ſhe thought ſhe heard ſomebody talk in the Arbour, and giving near notice to it, it ſeemed to be the voice of one complaining, which ſaluted her ears, much after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:54948:56"/>
               <hi>I love, and I likewiſe find I may have hope of being beloved again, yet he whoſe love I crave, knoweth me not; he ſeemeth to reſpect me as his friend, but do I deſire nothing more ſenſible? and yet methinks I am unjuſt to blame him for what he doth not know, for in the diſguiſe I am in, how can I expect he ſhould know what I would have him? yet how dare I reveal it to him? is there not a kind of modeſty that reſtrains me, from giving my tongue that liberty? Alas! I can but think if I ſhould go about it, how imperfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and with what faltring Speech I ſhould acquit my ſelf of it; nay my very Bluſhes would manifeſt my weakneſs to him. Ah</hi> Clidamant, <hi>what way ſhall I make uſe of then to diſcover to thee that ſecret thou leaſt dreameſt of? Ah</hi> Clarinda, <hi>thou art clearly loſt, happy hadſt thou been if thou hadſt never left</hi> Creet; <hi>but why do I ſay ſo, when I account all my happineſs to be in</hi> Cyprus? <hi>Should I tell him what I am, and that I love him? can I think it would not be the way to make me loſe his favour, and by imagining my humour to be light by ſuch a declaration? can I imagine too that he would not reject my generous prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer? But ſtay — I think I have begun a way al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready wherein, if I proceed, I may accompliſh my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign with prudence: that picture I gave him may help me much in it, Courage then</hi> Clarinda.</p>
            <p>After theſe words were ſpoke, <hi>Livia</hi> ran to the ſtone Steps to get to the Arbour to ſee who this <hi>Clarinda</hi> was, where when ſhe came ſhe found it to be <hi>Theocles,</hi> at which, being at firſt not a little amazed, it made him ſuſpect that ſhe had heard his diſcourſe; wherefore to prevent her from ſpeaking, and with a troubled countenance; he
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:54948:57"/>ſaid, I doubt not <hi>Livia</hi> but your Ears were wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of ſome fooliſh Diſcourſes I made but even now to my ſelf, but I imagin you are too diſcreet to believe them, or if you do, you are too pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to publiſh them, eſpecially to thoſe from whom they ought to be moſt concealed: What I have heard, replyed <hi>Livia,</hi> I have too long ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected not to believe: now confeſs then <hi>Theocles,</hi> confeſs to me, that you are a woman; if I can be ſerviceable to you in your Love-commerce, you may make uſe of one that will not betray you. Know then, <hi>Livia,</hi> replyed he, that I am a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, I am called <hi>Clarinda,</hi> and not to diſſemble with you, I muſt not diſown I love <hi>Clidamant,</hi> and that this Iſland was the firſt place of my Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity; I think I may not injoyn your ſecreſie, ſince it were to ſuſpect ill of you, for if my eyes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive me not, you have a countenance that bears marks of more honeſty and good nature. She would have proceeded, had not <hi>Livia</hi> told her how great the obligations were ſhe owed her for thoſe good Sentiments ſhe had of her, and that ſhe might be ſure ſhe would endeavour to conſerve her ſelf in her good opinion by keeping that concealed which was now diſcovered to her. <hi>Theocles</hi> then took his leave of her to go in to the reſt of the company, becauſe his too long ſtay might not raiſe ſome ſuſpicion in them. <hi>Livia</hi> continued ſtill in the Garden, where, after ſhe had fetched a great many turns, ſhe chanced to come near the other Arbour in the Terras-walk that was op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to this, where ſhe had heard <hi>Theocles,</hi> and there ſhe heard a noiſe, much after the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:54948:57"/>ſhe had heard in the former, and liſtning more attentively to it, ſhe thought it reſembled the voice of <hi>Emilia</hi> her Miſtreſs, which made her half ſuſpect the Garden was Inchanted; ſhe was reſolved to hear what it was ſhe ſaid, becauſe ſhe had had a ſuſpicion a great while, that ſhe was in Love, by reaſon ſhe was more retired and melancholy than ſhe was wont to be, but with whom ſhe could not divine, for ſhe knew that <hi>Orontus</hi> was ſlighted by her, wherefore ſhe had the patience to hear theſe words:</p>
            <p>I find I am unjuſt for being ſo cruel to <hi>Orontus,</hi> but alas had it not been for <hi>Theocles,</hi> I could not have given my ſelf theſe reproaches: yet when I think with what an indifferent Eye he looketh upon me, it ſometimes cauſeth me to ſay to my ſelf, Thou haſt deſerved to be thus treated, <hi>Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> for rejecting true Love for indifferency: but then <hi>Theocles</hi> knows not who loves him, if he did, perhaps he would carry himſelf with more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance towards me. Alas, theſe are but ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions too, for how could he chooſe but take notice of thy looks, <hi>Emilia,</hi> when thou wert in his preſence; what man is ſo ſtupid that cannot read love in a womans face, when her eyes ſparkle and dart pleaſing glances upon the object belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved? when a bluſh intermixt with a ſmile and a languiſhing look upon her lover, doth ſhow with what conſtraint ſhe would conceal her weakneſs. Then proceeded ſhe: Perhaps this Letter I have writ may not make me altogether deſpair, and though he may thereby think me bold, yet ſince I ſhall not be preſent to bluſh before him, it will
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:54948:58"/>not ſo much confound me; beſides, I know he is too generous to give a bad conſtruction on what a Lady ſends him. In ſaying this ſhe went forth of the Arbour into the Terras-walk, and <hi>Livia</hi> retched a turn another way; nevertheleſs in a ſmall time after <hi>Emilia</hi> ſpied her, and beckoned her to come to her, and accordingly ſhe obeyed: <hi>Livia,</hi> ſaid ſhe, the experience I have had of thy fidelity, doth not make me ſcruple to tell thee of the moſt inward paſſages of my heart; If I tell thee then that I love <hi>Theocles,</hi> I hope thou wilt not condemn me ſince thou art guilty of the ſame crime (if it be a crime) by loving <hi>Theobaldus.</hi> Follow the inſtructions that I ſhall give thee; touching my intrigue with <hi>Theocles,</hi> and as thou haſt been true to me hitherto, continue ſo for the future, and I do promiſe thee, I will bring it about, that <hi>Theobaldus</hi> ſhall be thy Husband, nay and more than that, I will give thee thy Wedding-Gown when thou marryeſt him. <hi>Livia</hi> ſmiled at theſe words, and modeſtly ſeemed to thank her: But (ſaid <hi>Emilia,</hi> proceeding in her Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe, and holding a Letter in her hand) this Letter, <hi>Livia,</hi> I'l recommend to thy care, it is for <hi>Theocles,</hi> do not give it him thy ſelf, but leave it to <hi>Orontus,</hi> and tell him from me, that if he hopes for any favour from me, he muſt give it to <hi>Theocles</hi> with his own hand; and withal, let him know, that in it I have fully expreſſed my mind to his friend, concerning the reſolution I'l take. <hi>Livia</hi> told her, That ſhe might aſſure her ſelf, that ſhe would acquit her ſelf of this Commiſſion, as ſhe deſired. Whereupon <hi>Livia</hi>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:54948:58"/>left her to effect her commands; but when ſhe was gone from her, how greatly did ſhe wonder at the ſtrangeneſs of this adventure, at leaſt ſhe thought it ſo; and had it not been that ſhe had promiſed ſecreſie to <hi>Theocles,</hi> ſhe had told <hi>Emilia</hi> that he was in a woman: theſe things could not chooſe but ſeem odd to her, <hi>Theocles</hi> is in love with <hi>Clidamant,</hi> who takes <hi>Theocles</hi> for a man, and <hi>Clidamant</hi> is in love with a Picture, the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of which, he believes, he never ſaw, when he ſees the true one every day: <hi>Emilia</hi> on the other ſide loves <hi>Theocles,</hi> whom ſhe know not to be a woman, and rejects the love of <hi>Orontus,</hi> who long had been her conſtant adorer: upon all which circumſtances, when <hi>Livia</hi> reflected, it was both a trouble and a paſtime to her; ſhe would not deliver <hi>Emilia</hi>'s Letter preſently to <hi>Orontus,</hi> but ſtayed two or three days to find out an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, in which time ſhe did, and gave the Letter to him, with the Inſtructions ſhe had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from her Miſtreſs; he ſeemed very glad of it, but could not deliver it preſently to <hi>Theocles,</hi> becauſe of the pleaſant Comedy that was paſſing between him and <hi>Clidamant,</hi> and ſeeing them in in diſcourſe together, as he thought, about ſome private affair, he out of civility retired. Being gone, I muſt confeſs, <hi>Theocles,</hi> ſaid <hi>Clidamant,</hi> that the oftner I look upon the Picture I received from you, I every time diſcover things that are more remarkable in it than I did before; I find in the Face now wonders, which does every mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute even add more fuel to make that fire burn the fiercer that conſumes me; I confeſs I once
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:54948:59"/>loved <hi>Emilia,</hi> and to all outward appearance, moſt tenderly; yet I find the love I have for this Idaea, doth manifeſt that it is poſſible to be endued with a love more tender than ever that was; and as my love to this unknown fair one doth daily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, ſo doth likewiſe my curioſity to ſee the perſon whom this Piece reſembles. Then with a look that almoſt ſpoke what he deſired; It is now a great while, <hi>Theocles,</hi> ſaid he, ſince you promiſed me a ſight of this beautiful Creature; when muſt be the time then, that I muſt ſee what I never yet did, but ever ſhall love? when muſt my eyes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy a happineſs that doth doubtleſs ſurpaſs all beautiful objects I ever yet ſaw? and when, <hi>Theocles,</hi> when ſhall I with an awe, that ſhall evidence as much the fear I have to offend, as the deſire my love inſpires me with to pleaſe her, let her know by whom ſhe is adored and admired, and who it is her ſhadow only hath made a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive?</p>
            <p>Are you reſolved then, replyed <hi>Theocles,</hi> to make choice of no Woman but the choice I have already made for you? you have the Picture of her I have pitched upon for you, and now it ſhall not be long before you have ſeen the party it was drawn for. Now you are kind, <hi>Theocles,</hi> ſaid <hi>Clida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant,</hi> the choice which you have made for me, I like ſo well, that if I would, yet would not my inclination permit me to love any other; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is ſhe that muſt give me either Life or Death, and I have ſome glimps of hope, by what you have told me of her, that her pitty may cauſe her to be inclined to the firſt rather than to
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:54948:59"/>the latter. Then, ſaid <hi>Theocles</hi> ſmiling, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you think to make an eaſie conqueſt of her, before you have ſeen her: In truth your humour is pleaſant; you have ſo good an opinion of her I ſee, that you think ſhe loves no delays by a tedious courtſhip: in that perhaps too ſhe may agree with you, for ſhe may think them ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous; yet let me tell you, <hi>Clidamont,</hi> that though ſhe doth not love ſuperfluities, ſhe is ſo prudent that ſhe loves to try her pretendets, before ſhe will let them know her mind, and then whoever ſhe thinks moſt worthy, them to be ſure ſhe will gratifie. Suppoſe me, <hi>Clidamant,</hi> to be that La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, whom you pretend to love, and whom that Picture repreſents, and let me ſee after what gallant manner you will Court me, to make me increaſe the good opinion I have of you. Agreed, anſwered <hi>Clidamant,</hi> it is but a frolick, and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you ſhall ſee that I'll behave my ſelf before you, as if I were in her preſence; then making a low obeyſance to <hi>Theocles,</hi> he thus began; Madam, I need not tell you how much I was your admirer before I ſaw you, for that were to ſay, that Nature had not framed you more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect than the Painter hath done, but when I tell you that his Workmanſhip did firſt inſpire my heart with love, I hope, Madam, you will with reaſon believe that the works of Nature being more fair and perfect than their repreſentations, that if I loved you then, I love you more now than ever; I believed I could love any, and as the Painters in their Land-skips of Woods, Rocks, Meadows, and every thing elſe that is made to
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:54948:60"/>pleaſe the eye and fancy, cannot in picturing the the Heavens draw the Sun with that ſplendour it therein appears, but only by ſome faint ſtroaks re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the beams it ſends forth a little before its riſing, or ſometime after its ſetting, ſo ſhew what they would do, if they could: even ſo, doubtleſs, Lady, he could do no other by you, ſome ſhining rayes he has adormed you with, to let the beholder ſee, that what he imitated was extraordinary, and that he would fain have done more, if his cunning could have accompliſhed it.— He was proceeding, when his ſeemingly pretended Lady prevented him, ſaying, You are very expert, <hi>Clidamant,</hi> at your ſubtil flattering expreſſions, to ſteal a Ladys heart away when ſhe is fartheſt from ſuſpecting of any ſuch thing; but alas, you Gallants are all alike, you will ſwear by Heaven, and all that's moſt Holy therein; and by that which you flatteringly term Beauty, that you adore your Miſtreſſes with ſuch a reſolute conſtancy, as cannot be parallelled; and yet a new object extinguiſheth thoſe deſires you had for the firſt, to be rekindled in your mind for the ſecond, inſomuch that all your pretended con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy conſiſteth in being conſtantly inconſtant; which quality, if a Lady knows a Gentleman to be endowed with, can you think (if ſhe be wiſe) that ſhe will give him any incouragement in his pretenſions to her? I underſtood, <hi>Clida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant,</hi> by a friend of mine, that your humour doth not much differ from this, and that you once loved a fair Lady, whoſe Beauty, I am ſure, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves not to be ſlighted by you, for the ſight of
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:54948:60"/>any new face whatſoever; yet becauſe you love not to Love too long forſooth in one place, you have forſook her to deceive another in the ſame kind. Ah Madam, ſaid he paſſionately, call you that inconſtancy, when the cruel rigour of her you ſpeak of, forced me to that I ſhould other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe never have done, had I received that favour from her I moſt deſired, I mean her Love, and after this obligation, had I ingratefully forſaken her, then might I have been termed inconſtant, and then might ſhe have ſaid, Falſe Man, is this my recompence? have I deſerved this for making my tongue and heart agree? But ſince her greateſt deſire was to be freed from my importunities, and ſince the greateſt kindneſs I could do her, was to be ſeldom in her preſence, which did plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly teſtifie the averſion ſhe had towards me; what ſhould I have done, Madam, ſince I could never ſo much as hope for what I deſired? did I not make uſe of the beſt means, by courageouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering this ſullen paſſion? and truly, Madam, it is none but you I muſt render thanks for taking me out of this Captivity, to bring me, I hope, to one ſo pleaſing to me, that thereby I may fancy my ſelf to be at more liberty, by wearing your chains, and to taſt more ſweetneſs than ever my life did afford me, when I thought my ſelf at the very height of freedom: give me then that love the rigour of my firſt Miſtreſs refuſed me, and by my conſtancy you'l find how laſting and true mine is: I ſhall then likewiſe enjoy thoſe ſweets I before mentioned, and which I hitherto did never find. Here <hi>Theocles</hi> ſighed, and then ſaid,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:54948:61"/>Well <hi>Clidamant,</hi> I'll try how faithful you will be to her you love. But Lord, what do I ſay, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded ſhe, I have made a promiſe to my ſelf to love no body, that promiſe is unjuſt; No body? ſaid <hi>Clidamant:</hi> but <hi>Clidamant,</hi> anſwered ſhe; and in ſpeaking that, ſhe bluſhed ſo extremely, that if ſhe had not cunningly, upon ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence turned her face another way, ſhe would doubtleſs have betrayed her ſelf: this then made her reſolve to break off this diſcourſe, which though perhaps ſhe thought not very unpleaſant, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhe imagined it might reveal a weakneſs in her, which ſhe had, as yet, no mind to have diſcovered. After then ſhe had rallied with him, upon what had paſſed between them, their diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes were concerning matters altogether indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, in which interim <hi>Orontus</hi> entred, and whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpering <hi>Theocles</hi> in the ear, told him, he had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to deliver him from <hi>Emilia; Clidamant</hi> thinking it not decency to remain there any longer, departed the Room, and ſcarce was he gone, when <hi>Orontus</hi> produced the Letter, and delivered it to <hi>Theocles,</hi> telling him that <hi>Emilia</hi> had certified him in that Letter, concerning the reſolution ſhe would take touching himſelf. <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> opened it, and with much amazement read theſe words:
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:54948:61"/>
               <q>
                  <p>Emilia <hi>to</hi> Theocles.</p>

                     <hi>I</hi> Know not whether theſe Lines may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their wiſhed-for ſucceſs, as well becauſe I expoſe my ſelf to your cenſure, by doing what ſo ill ſuits with our Sex, as becauſe I never found you in the leaſt inclined to what I could deſire you were: If for ſaying I love you, your unkindneſs can reach to that extent as to hate me for ſaying ſo, I muſt then prepare to ſuffer an indignity, occaſioned by my impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. I never before indeavoured to ſeek, and I muſt confeſs, had I not ſeen ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in you not common in other Men, I had not bluſhed by writing theſe Lines: keep that concealed then from <hi>Orontus,</hi> which I would have no body to know but your ſelf; and let me know whether it lyes in your power to oblige</p>
                  <p>

            <p>
               <hi>Orontus</hi> asked <hi>Theocles</hi> after he had read the Letter, whether there was any comfort in it for him? <hi>Theocles</hi> looks then began to be troubled, but clearing them up again as well as he could, not to make <hi>Orontus</hi> ſuſpect what he had moſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to fear; and having thought what to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, bid him take courage, for it was all ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable on his behalf, that if he ſaw it he would ſcarce believe it: and to that end therefore ſhe had in it forbid him to let him ſee it, becauſe ſhe had no deſire to let him too ſoon know that which would ſo much pleaſe him. If, ſaid <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> I have told you what perhaps you ſhould not know, I doubt not but you are ſo diſcreet, as to behave your ſelf ſo before her, as if you knew it not; and however cruel ſhe ſeems to you, let not that cauſe your trouble, becauſe I tell you ſhe hath here expreſſed her ſelf more favourably perhaps then you could think: and after he had begged his pardon of him, for not ſhewing him the Letter, poor <hi>Orontus</hi> departed the Chamber with a very joyful heart, little thinking after what manner he was deceived. When he was gone, <hi>Theocles</hi> was at a ſtand to know what he ſhould do in this intricate buſineſs; but he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſo not long, becauſe he thought he had found out a way to help <hi>Orontus</hi> to what in all likelihood he was ſo far diſtant from: which this deſign in his head then he quitted the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, with an intention to viſit <hi>Emilia,</hi> whom he happily found in her own apartment, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be very melancholy, for there was no body with her but <hi>Livia,</hi> at his firſt entring into the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:54948:62"/>Chamber ſhe turned her face away to conceal ſome bluſhes from him, which ſhe had no mind he ſhould ſee: by which modeſt baſhfulneſs <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> nevertheleſs might perceive, that ſhe was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to a conſtrained repentance, for ſending that favourable Letter. Therefore ſaid he to her (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, as yet, he had no deſire to let her know what he was) Madam, though your beauty be capable to charm the very Gods themſelves, and to make them forſake their heaven, for one more delightful here below; though all the graces that dwell in that face, and the pure carnation which nature hath ſpread in thoſe cheeks that dart forth ſuch powerful influences, as to make all thoſe that behold you become your Captives: and Madam, though I am one among the reſt, the love of you muſt kill, but not permit me to pretend to what will make me undeſerving of thoſe high favours you have conferred upon me, which indeed have been ſo great, that by giving you a denyal, I may appear to you in ſome ſort ungrateful, yet I hope, Madam, when you ſhall conſider that on the other ſide, I ſhall be not only ungrateful but perfidious, by betraying my friend, who intruſted me with his hearts moſt ſecret paſſages, and who not only did that, but imployed me to indeavour to obtain that from you, which he himſelf could never do; you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſo unjuſt as to ſuffer it: Shall I then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray poor <hi>Orontus</hi> that loves you, and puts his confidence in me? Shall I do that, Madam, which I, when I have done, you will with juſtice eſteem me unworthy of what I wiſh I could tell how to
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:54948:63"/>accept or receive otherwiſe? Beſides, he that will be unfaithful to his friend, will certainly be ſo to any other; may not you with reaſon fear then Madam, (after ſuch an action) that I would be ſo to you?</p>
            <p>Am I then ſlighted by you <hi>Theocles?</hi> replied <hi>Emilia,</hi> ungrateful Man! are Ladys ſo prodigal of ſuch favours as I have thrown upon you, as this ought to be eſteemed of ſo? No, no, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded ſhe, I did not expect this requital: thy baſeneſs, unwòrthy man, ſhall now baniſh thee from my mind for ever; I'll conquer that which hath made me indanger my honour, and which I only have done by ſaying, I loved thee; yet this poor refuſal from thee is returned me, inſtead of affection, and though my love was honourable (as I imagine; if you know me, you think no otherwiſe) I ſee you prize a Friend more than a Miſtreſs, the tender love of which doth far better deſerve that name than the other; love and friendſhip are there ſo linked together, that ſuch a one deſerves to be called the friend of friends. But notwithſtanding, all this diſdain and ſcorn muſt be the effect of your ill-bred Gallantry.</p>
            <p>I beſeech you forbear theſe injuries, Madam, (ſaid <hi>Theocles,</hi> in interrupting) her when I tell you that you have overcome; I may with reaſon call them ſo; and though I never yet loved woman, I find your eyes are inducements too perſwaſive to make me be ſtill in love with freedom; and yet methinks I wiſh I could not love you, that you might love deſpairing <hi>Orontus,</hi> whom you will
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:54948:63"/>doubtleſs kill. But alas, I find (ſaid he, with a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit ſigh) that my love is too great, to let my Rival have what I would ſolely have to my ſelf. I could likewiſe wiſh, ſaid <hi>Emilia,</hi> that I could love <hi>Orontus</hi> his perſon, I confeſs it is not unhandſom, neither are his parts unanſwerable to it; but yet if I may ſay ſo, <hi>Theocles,</hi> I find I know not what in you, which I cannot ſee in <hi>Orontus;</hi> I find ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo worthy of my affection, that my very reaſon doth ſeem to ſay to me, fix thy love there, <hi>Emilia:</hi> and now ſince you have begun to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve what I doubt not but I have worthily placed, let me ſee how conſtant you will prove.</p>
            <p>You ſhall find I ſhall not be unconſtant, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed <hi>Theocles;</hi> but Madam, as a mark of that love you are pleaſed to beſtow upon your unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy ſervant, may I preſume to ask you to grant a requeſt, I am going to demand of you? What is it <hi>Theocles?</hi> ſaid ſhe: But a promiſe, (Madam, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered he) of no great importance. 'Tis granted already, what ever it be, ſaid ſhe; therefore pray let me hear it. Only, proceeded he, that if ever it ſhould happen, that you refuſe to make me your Bride-groom, you would confer that happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs on <hi>Orontus,</hi> with the love you bear me. If that be all, ſaid ſhe, I do once again confirm my promiſe; for ſhould I ever refuſe you, it would be me you might firſt tax with incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy; but that I am certain will never come to paſs. I wiſh the thing you made me promiſe had been of greater conſequence, added ſhe, for I find I can deny you nothing that is decent. Then Madam, ſaid <hi>Theocles,</hi> (becauſe he would par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:54948:64"/>of ſome Mirth) I'l be bold to beg another favour of you. You ſhall likewiſe have it, ſaid ſhe, therefore let me know your deſire. My de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire is only, Madam, ſaid he, ſmiling, That you would let me ſeal the Covenant, that was now made between us. How do you mean <hi>Theocles?</hi> replied ſhe: Upon thoſe cherry Lips, Madam, ſaid he. Whereupon he preſently ſaluted her, which made the Roſes of her Cheeks wear a deeper dye then they did before: and <hi>Orontus</hi> entred the Chamber in the ſame inſtant, and ſaw him do that which did not a little diſpleaſe him. During his ſtay there, <hi>Theocles</hi> read an anger in his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, which he feared would too ſoon break out; yet he ſmiled in himſelf, to think how cauſleſs his anger was, if he knew all. the more cruel his Miſtreſs ſeemed to him, the more did his trouble ſeem to increaſe; and had it not been for the reſpect of her, in whoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence he was, he had doubtleſs made an open manifeſtation of his diſpleaſure on <hi>Theocles;</hi> who, becauſe he would give him no further oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, went forth of the room. <hi>Orontus</hi> ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined <hi>Emilia</hi> to be far more rigorous to him than ſhe had been yet, and therefore his ſuſpicion that <hi>Theocles</hi> had done him a diſcourteſie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed the more: he ſeeing then that all his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations, all his vows to her of the faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his love, and all his unfained ſighs, did ſeem but the more to harden that heart he indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to ſoften, took his leave of her ſoon after <hi>Theocles,</hi> even with the tears in his eyes, and ſcarce was he got out of the chamber door, but
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:54948:64"/>he found a piece of Paper handſomly wrapped up like a Letter, which it ſeems <hi>Theocles</hi> had chanced to drop out of his Pocket; <hi>Orontus</hi> had no ſooner found it, but looking upon it, there it was he ſaw <hi>Emilia</hi> to <hi>Theocles:</hi> he had both the curioſity and patience to ſee what it contained, which when he underſtood, you muſt needs think the latter left him to give way to rage, and the firſt continued to find out <hi>Theocles,</hi> whom he ſwore he would kill, whereſoever he met him; he raved, ſtamped, and poured forth all the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precations he could invent againſt poor <hi>Theocles;</hi> he called him whatever can be thought moſt vile; and not long after finding him by chance, by the Sea-ſide, he thus accoſted him, with his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Sword in one hand and <hi>Emilia</hi>'s Letter in the other.</p>
            <p>Inſolent Traytor, canſt thou think to breath in this innocent Air, after thy perfidious, falſe and unworthy Action? was it this Letter gave thee incouragement, to behave thy ſelf with that baſeneſs? and ſhe, O cruel Woman! does ſhe hate me, to love this Traytor? but my Sword, ſaid he, flouriſhing of it in his hand, ſhall chaſtiſe thee, therefore defend thy ſelf, if thy guilt will permit thee to fight in ſo bad a cauſe.</p>
            <p>Hold <hi>Orontus,</hi> ſaid <hi>theocles,</hi> trembling, becauſe he never had been uſed to ſuch Weapons, whoſe very glittering ſtruck terrour into him; I am no Traytor <hi>Orontus,</hi> as you believe me to be, but on the contrary, you will find that I have done you ſervice. Bold affronter! replyed <hi>Orontus,</hi> what doſt thou deride me after thy treacheries? did I not
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:54948:65"/>with theſe eyes ſee what thou didſt to abuſe me, when I came into her Chamber? did you not alſo deceive me, by telling me what ſhe never writ? wherefore I will not believe any thing you ſhall ſay more.</p>
            <p>He was going to bid him draw, when <hi>Agenoris</hi> and <hi>Clidamant</hi> were come towards them, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving asked <hi>Orontus</hi> the meaning of the poſture they ſaw him in, he excuſed it with a Joak, which was likewiſe forwarded by <hi>Theocles,</hi> for they were not ſo near them, as to hear what they ſpake. <hi>Orontus</hi> then for the preſent diſſembled his trouble, and they both accompanied <hi>Agenoris,</hi> whom <hi>Clidamant</hi> had perſwaded to walk out, to divert himſelf, for grief had ſo changed him, and melancholy was ſo predominant in him, ever ſince his return home, for the loſs of her he ſo dearly loved, that it was to be feared it would kill him, if they did not try to prevent it, by cauſing him ſometime to take the Air, and to uſe all manner of noble and heroick exerciſes, to expel that tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting Grief, the chiefeſt of which was Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but alas, he took little pleaſure in it, for ſometimes would he ſtray from the reſt of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and retiring to ſome ſolitary place, there would he to the Trees, and to the ſenceleſs Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that embelliſhed the Graſs, give a pretty, though mournful account, of his preſent ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and from the yearly droppings of the Dew from their fragrant tops, would he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times extract comfort, becauſe they ſeemed to be his companions in ſorrow, and to weep with him. All thoſe that did for the moſt part accompany
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:54948:65"/>him, did labour by all the Paſtimes, Exerciſes, and Diverſions they could invent, to diſſipate thoſe foggy ſmoaks of ſorrow; but they might as well indeavour to ſtop the courſe of a Ship in a furious ſtorm, or call back time, and they would both have come to the ſame effect; for alas, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>Melliſſa</hi> had that vertue, reaſon was too weak with him to overcome his grief; the abſence and death of his Love made it the more exceſſive, the thoughts of greatneſs and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty were forgot to think of his dead Shepher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs.</p>
            <p>After they had fetched two or three turns upon the Sea-ſhore, all the company but <hi>Theocles</hi> returned to the Caſtle, whither they were ſcarce come, but with a common conſent they went into <hi>Emilia</hi>'s Chamber, to entertain her, the ſubject of their diſcourſe was for the moſt part indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, till at length, coming to diſcourſe of Love, eſpecially of the ſincerity with which <hi>Agenoris</hi> loved; Verily, ſaid <hi>Clidamant,</hi> we muſt be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to confeſs, by the ſad experience we have now had of Loves dire effects, that the little ſtripling is not to be mocked at, for on my word, we are all witneſſes, nay, and ſome of us know that he doth generally ſtick his Arrows very deep, he is almoſt like Death, though not ſo terrible, he makes no diſtinction between Monarchs and others. Lord! how unruly, how reſtleſs is a love-ſick heart? our deſires continue always diſſatisfied, till we have got what we moſt deſired, and then our pain is ſomewhat eaſed.</p>
            <p>Love (though by ſome dull fools it is termed
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:54948:66"/>the moſt ſlaviſh of Paſſions) yet ought it to be eſteemed the moſt Noble: Anger doth often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times make a man forget his Honour, and do thoſe things which are always ended with a deep repentance: Love on the contrary raiſes a mans thoughts to ſomething more ſublime, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth a man to ſeek Honour, to appear ſo in the eyes of her he loves; and the end of Love is joy and ſatisfaction. Fear there are ſeveral ſorts of, there is fear in Love, a fear of offending the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject loved, not a cowardly ſlaviſh fear, but a he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick and meritorious fear.</p>
            <p>That ſervile paſſion that makes a man fear his own ſhadow is here not meant, nor that which makes men tremble at the ſight of War-like In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, nor that which ſome have of Death, for a true Lover will ſacrifice his Life on any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for his Miſtreſs: theſe are the fears which Lovers ſeldom or never have, by what they have not, you may with eaſe gueſs what that pure fear is they have, or ſhould have, for Love is not Love without it, nay it cannot ſubſiſt. Some are ſo rigid and moroſs, as to make no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction between Love and Luſt, but it muſt be confeſſed that theſe are thoſe that never knew what the firſt was, though by having acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with the latter, they would ſeem to force the World into a belief, that their Vices are general, and that a man may alſo love with conſtancy and purity, and yet not be a Platonick lover; it is ſo certain, that I think it a folly to diſpute it.</p>
            <p>How deeply I love the memory of my Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdeſs,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:54948:66"/>ſaid <hi>Agenoris,</hi> though fate hath too ſoon deprived me of her, and how purely I lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved her before ſhe was ſnatched from my preſence, notwithſtanding ſhe gave me no hopes I ſhould ever taſte the ſenſible pleaſures of Love; how I loved, I ſay, you can all witneſs, which Love I ſuppoſe you can find no reaſon to call Luſt; had I indeavoured to ſeduce her, and make her ſubmit to my unlawful deſires (but Heaven knows my deſires were limited, I may in a manner ſay by her ſight and company) my care would then have extended no further than to have compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed my vitious aims; but ſince I did not, it makes me find a clear diſtinction between Love and Luſt; there is ſweetneſs to be found in the firſt, but bitterneſs in the laſt; the firſt is clean and ſpotleſs, the latter is filthy and black: yet is not my Love Platonical neither, though it inſpired me with a deſire of obtaining what I loved.</p>
            <p>What I am going to tell you, ſaid <hi>Clidamant,</hi> may perhaps ſeem ſtrange to you, though it agree well with what you ſay (ſo pulling out his Picture, that <hi>Theocles</hi> had given him) and ſhewing it to <hi>Agenoris</hi> and the reſt of the company: This Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, added he, I am in love with, whether the party it reſembles be in being or no, or whether the Painter hath gone no further here than his own fancy told him, I know not, but I had it from <hi>Theocles;</hi> and ſo he related to them all that <hi>Theocles</hi> had told him concerning this Lady, and the promiſe <hi>Theocles</hi> had cauſed him to make, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Miſtreſs he was to chuſe him: they were mightily ſurpriſed at the beauty of the face, and
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:54948:67"/>did acknowledge it to be truly admirable: they had not diſcourſed above four hours, when <hi>Livia,</hi> who had been out of the Chamber a great while entred it again, followed by a young Lady in the moſt glorious Apparel, and with the moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtical preſence that eyes ever ſaw, or heart ever admired; her head was covered with a Vail, whereby the moſt beautiful part, her face was like the Sun, when ſhadowed by ſome interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Cloud unſeen; her Apparel was blue Sat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and covered ſo thick with flowers of Gold, intermingled with precious Stones, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhe came her ſparkling preſence ſeemed to create a new day; her Train was held up by a Rage, and on the left hand of her, walked a grave old man in Apparel ſuitable to his years. The eyes of the company were all not only fixed upon this prodigious object, but all of them won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered who it ſhould be, and to what her coming thither tended: but <hi>Livia</hi> ſoon made their won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ceaſe, when leading her before them, and pulling up her Vail, Behold here, ſaid ſhe, in directing her ſpeech to <hi>Agenoris,</hi> the loſt <hi>Melliſſa.</hi> No ſooner had ſhe ended theſe words, but <hi>Age<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neris</hi> having diſcovered it to be indeed that <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſſa</hi> he thought was no more, he would ſcarce believe what he with his eyes ſaw, nay, he thought they were deluded, and that it was only the ſtrength of his imagination, that made him conceive, what he in all likelihood believed to be impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. His wonder was not unaccompanied, for the reſt were in as great admiration as he. He ſat ſtill a while, making uſe of no other Language
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:54948:67"/>but his eyes, which were intentively fixed upon this charming Nymph, and beholding her both with fear and joy, ſhe continuing ſilent. Do I dream? ſaid he, if I do, may I thus dream for ever. Or is it poſſible, beautious Angel, that the Gods have yet reſerved thee to ſhine here below? Miracle of Miracles! I muſt confeſs thou wouldſt have graced the Heavens with a new Star, the brightneſs of whoſe beams, would, like the Sun, have obſcured all other lights. But who knows but they have done it for the good of us Mortals, that we may have our Sun here below, as they have thiers in their Heaven. Bright Queen of beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, thou pretty reviver of diſconſolate hearts, for without thee I had been without my ſelf; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thee I had been a walking ſhadow, a meer nothing, a meer lump of Snow, melting away without pity under the Sun beams. I know thou did'ſt remember there was an <hi>Agenoris</hi> in the world that loved thee, and to doubt that thou ſometimes gaveſt him a gentle entertainment in thy thoughts, were to reproach thee of what thou canſt not be guilty of. Here <hi>Livia</hi> beckoned him to be a while ſilent, becauſe <hi>Melliſſa</hi> gave him no anſwer, therefore ſhe ſpoke to him in this ſort:</p>
            <p>How much you are deceived, <hi>Agenoris,</hi> I cannot forbear to interrupt you, that I may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceive you as well as the reſt of this company. Now you have been all ſo credulous to believe me, when I told you this was <hi>Melliſſa,</hi> what will you ſay, when I tell you it is not <hi>Melliſſa,</hi>— although it once was ſhe, but alaſs, ſhe is now changed.—</p>
            <pb n="120" facs="tcp:54948:68"/>
            <p>Gods! ſaid <hi>Agenoris,</hi> What is it I hear, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be? ſpeak not the reſt, for fear I ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Heavens to be without Gods, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Infidel, for as ſoon may that be, as ſhe be taxed with unconſtancy. Yet ſpeak what you have more to ſay, for I can hear, though not believe, I am ſo well acquainted with her Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.</p>
            <p>Know then, ſaid <hi>Livia,</hi> that ſhe hath changed her condition.</p>
            <p>Ah! worſe and worſe! ſaid he, pray Heaven my fears augment not; but ſince I have begun to know my doom, I am reſolved now to hear the utmoſt; and ſtill methinks my mind gives me, that <hi>Melliſſa</hi>'s ſoul cannot be black, ſure ſhe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not. Muſt I attribute this her ſilence, to be a confirmation of <hi>Livia</hi>'s diſcourſe, or may it be her modeſty that I wrong, in ſuppoſing it to be guilty? be it what it will, I muſt know.</p>
            <p>Then ſaid he to <hi>Livia,</hi> Is ſhe eſpouſed? Yes my Lord, replied <hi>Livia.</hi> Now my fears are out, ſaid he, unkind and hard hearted Maid: Was it for this, I have been always dying, ſince the time I parted from thee? <hi>Melliſſa</hi> made no reply, but held down her head. And then ſaid he to <hi>Livia,</hi> To whom is ſhe eſpouſed? To a better Fate, ſaid <hi>Livia.</hi> I am ſtill in the dark, replied <hi>Agenoris,</hi> prithee, <hi>Livia,</hi> explain thy ſelf more at large, for my heart doth almoſt ſeem to check my tongue, for calling her unkind, though by all thou haſt hitherto told me, I do ſeem to ſay juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, therefore pray rid me from this trouble and confuſion.</p>
            <pb n="121" facs="tcp:54948:68"/>
            <p>My Lord, I am going to obey you, ſaid <hi>Livia,</hi> and ſhall draw a ſhady cloud from before your eyes, that in clearing all your doubts and fears, will notwithſtanding raiſe a new ſubject of wonder among you all. Look upon this Lady then, ſaid ſhe, in pointing to <hi>Melliſſa,</hi> no more as <hi>Melliſſa,</hi> who was a Shepherdeſs, poor in every thing but her Vertues and Beauty, but behold her to be the divine <hi>Alcandra,</hi> Princeſs of <hi>Sicily;</hi> ſhe that was ſuppoſed to dye before ſhe was three years old, ſhe who is endued with all the excellencies that are capable of adorning Majeſty; ſhe who when ſhe was ſuppoſed a Shepherdeſs, had even then the port and grace of what her Birth hath really made her. I ſhall not indeavour to perſwade you to believe what I ſay, becauſe, ſaid ſhe, point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ancient Gentleman, that Lord will produce thoſe proofs that will make it plain enough.</p>
            <p>They were all ſo tranſported with amazement at theſe unexpected tidings, that they knew not in a manner what to think or ſay; they all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plemented her in the beſt manner they could, and <hi>Agenoris</hi> was the firſt, with one Knee on the ground, that kiſſed her hand, whom all the reſt did imitate, which they had ſcarce done, when ſhe addreſſed her Speech to <hi>Agenoris</hi> in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner?</p>
            <p>I am now come to make good my word with you, <hi>Agenoris,</hi> fortune hath now, beyond my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, ſhined favourably upon me; you know what I promiſed you, and now I can with my Love beſtow a Crown upon you, which I would
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:54948:69"/>intreat you to accept of, as a debt due to your noble conſtancy. You, that are a Gentleman, did caſt down a look upon me, when I was no other than a Shepherdeſs; and I, whom fate hath ſeemed to raiſe above you, in placing me in a Throne, ſhould be indeed ingrateful, to forget my Vows to <hi>Agenoris,</hi> after ſuch tokens of generoſity. If up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my firſt approach to you, you perceived me to be ſilent, and if <hi>Livia,</hi> likewiſe, gave you doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful anſwers to your demands, according to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der I gave her, imagine it to be, becauſe I was curious to know whether <hi>Age oris</hi> had not forgot his <hi>Melliſſa,</hi> for by this tryal, I believed, I could find out how you would brook my ſeparation from you, by my pretended inconſtancy. The Oracle, <hi>Agenoris,</hi> is now explained, your own eyes ſeemed to be witneſſes of my Death, when mine did likewiſe behold the like Spectacle of yours; the approaching danger the Gods foretold is now over, wherefore we muſt expect our fill of happineſs.</p>
            <p>Pardon me, divine Madam, ſaid <hi>Agenoris,</hi> if the Gods have not accompliſhed all they foretold; I muſt acknowledge I am of Princely Blood, but fortune hath not ſo inriched me with her boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as to make me deſerve ſuch large ones as you are pleaſed to expreſs. Alas, I have no King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to beſtow, Madam, I have nothing that may make me ſeem worthy in your eyes, if you will give me leave to ſay to my ſelf, I love you (and truly I love more than I can ſay) that is all I do preſume to ask. Yet, Madam, the ſame promiſe your goodneſs once made me, the ſame will I
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:54948:69"/>here confirm to you, if fortune ſhould hereafter chance to ſmile, then, Madam, I'll beg that you would too. I am ſorry that fate will not let me hope for what I muſt love, and in the ſtate I am in, it is a grace too too great, that you would give me leave to ſay ſo.</p>
            <p>My noble Lord, replied <hi>Alcandra,</hi> ever ſince I firſt ſaw you, I have diſcerned ſome marks of greatneſs in your countenance, which indeed did ever make me believe what you have now told me; it is not poſſeſſions that create deſerts, for then the moſt undeſerving perſons would be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with merit; beſides, my love is not ſo poor as to deſcend to things ſo abject as you mention; my flame is more noble, to love you only for what you do poſſeſs (except it be your Vertues and Merit) it were to love you impurely, or rather it were not to love you, therefore cancel your raſh promiſe.—</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Agenoris</hi> was juſt going to anſwer, had it not been for another Lady that came into the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber at that inſtant, who having firſt made a low obeiſſance to <hi>Agenoris</hi> and the reſt of the company, who all beheld her with great aſtoniſhment, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <hi>Clidamant,</hi> who thought ſhe ſomewhat reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the Picture he had, yet he could not believe it to be ſhe, for whom it was drawn, becauſe the Picture was not ſo beautiful: but much more were they ſurprized when ſhe told them that they all once knew her as <hi>Theocles,</hi> a man, but never yet as <hi>Clarinda,</hi> a woman. I ſhall not need to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire you to call me the latter, ſaid ſhe, becauſe you ſee my Sex not only requires it, but it is
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:54948:70"/>alſo a name that is real, whereas the firſt was feigned. They remained all of them ſome time ſilent, they were ſo confounded, and they beheld her with admiration, for if when ſhe ſeemed to be a man, ſhe made one ſo handſom, that ſhe was without compariſon; now ſhe was a woman ſhe was ſo extremely fair and pretty, that no Sun could out-ſhine her. <hi>Clidamant</hi> bleſſed himſelf a thouſand times, for that the Gods had been ſo favourable to him; what her Picture only excited in his ſoul, her preſence did make it double: his extaſie was ſo great, that he wanted words to utter his tranſports; but after he had a while ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently admired at what he ſaw; Heavens! (ſaid he to himſelf) what a divine Lady is here? who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſees her without a heart enflamed, he either loves not, or doth not know the ſweet delights of Love.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Emilia</hi> was going to ſpeak, when <hi>Clarinda</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in her diſcourſe. There are ſeveral things I know, ſaid ſhe, that may ſeem incredible to this Illuſtrious Company, if I ſhould not explain them; one I know is my continuance in this diſguiſe all this time; the other is the ſtrangeneſs of my ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val to this Iſland. As to the firſt, to ſpeak truth, I had a deſire to have my Sex concealed, but all that I ſhall ſay now, for to excuſe my diſcovery, is only to intreat <hi>Emilia</hi> to remember her promiſe. However, ſaid ſhe, ſmiling, if ſhe thinks me a fit Bridegroom for her, I am content.</p>
            <p>Well, I ſee, replied <hi>Emilia,</hi> that notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all my ſtrong reſolutions to the contrary, I muſt refuſe you now; I think I was guilty of no
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:54948:70"/>crime in loving you, ſince never any man was ſeen with a face ſo lovely, and though I loved you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, imagining you to be the wonder of the Male Sex, my love muſt not forſake you now, becauſe I muſt ſtill love you as my dear friend.</p>
            <p>However, ſaid <hi>Clarinda,</hi> going to <hi>Orontus,</hi> and making him conduct her, or rather ſhe him, Here ſaid ſhe, <hi>Orontus,</hi> cauſing <hi>Emilia</hi> to give him her hand, Now enjoy fair weather, after all this foul, ſhe is yours, <hi>Orontus,</hi> ſhe'll be no more cruel now for my ſake, the love ſhe bore me, ſhe now beſtows on you: ſee, ſaid ſhe, that bluſh doth now confirm what ſhe promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed me.</p>
            <p>Then, ſaid <hi>Emilia,</hi> (in a low note, after ſhe had compoſed her countenance, which was a little diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered) ſince Promiſes ſhould never be broke, and ſince Fate hath thus unexpectedly ordered things, I do not ſo much think, <hi>Orontus,</hi> ſaid ſhe, that you deſerve to have a place here (laying her hand upon her heart) but alſo that your conſtancy and your long ſervice may more than have deſerved it; therefore to conſer the love I had for <hi>Theocles</hi> on you, is the leaſt I can do, but the moſt I am inclined to.</p>
            <p>Then was it that <hi>Orontus</hi> ſaluted her hand, but with the greateſt Rapture imaginable, and replied, I am ſo over-joyed, Madam, at this fulneſs of bliſs, that I want words to thank you for it. And then directing his Speech to <hi>Clarinda;</hi> Can you pardon, Madam, the rudeneſs I lately committed againſt you, I muſt confeſs it was ignorance made me guilty of it, but I hope you are ſo good, that ſince now I know my fault, and am grown a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent, you will forgive me; the obligation like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:54948:71"/>I owe you, for this days happineſs doth even ſtupifie my ſenſes, when I think how little I have deſerved this from you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Clainda</hi> returned his complements in as gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant a manner as could be, when <hi>Emilia</hi> going to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Clidamant,</hi> whoſe eyes were ſtedfaſtly fixed upon the fair <hi>Clarinda,</hi> told her, That as ſhe had been the occaſion of extracting the performance of a promiſe from her, on the behalf of <hi>Orontus,</hi> ſhe did now likewiſe expect, that ſhe ſhould do the like on the behalf of <hi>Clidamant:</hi> For, ſaid <hi>Emilia</hi> to her, I know who it was you promiſed to beſtow on <hi>Clidamant,</hi> nay, and he hath deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved her, I'll aſſure you, ſince he loved her ſo ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly before he ſaw her. Perhaps, (replied <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinda,</hi> in a faint voice) he may not with juſtice do what he promiſed, becauſe it is not unlikely that he hath found out ſome fair Lady, whoſe merits are far greater, wherefore I ſhall not urge him to perform what he hath promiſed. Ye Gods, ſaid <hi>Clidamant,</hi> running to her, and ſaluting her fair hand with much eagerneſs, can I hear this, and not die? fair Jewel, ſaid he, either ſuffer me to perform the promiſe I made to your dear ſelf (for if you were once <hi>Theocles,</hi> it was to no other) and grant I may obtain what I have ſo long humbly ſued for, or with the wound thoſe ſhining eyes have given my heart, give me that which may end my days, for any thing (whatever it be) fair ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, if it come from you, it can be no other than welcome. Do you think I can kill you then, <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damant?</hi> ſaid ſhe, no; here, now take your <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinda,</hi> if you die with any thing from me, it muſt
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:54948:71"/>be the exceſs of my love muſt kill you. Kind Love, I thank thee, ſaid <hi>Clidamant,</hi> for affording me ſuch heavenly Joys, thy Deity ſhall be ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by me, and thy Altars ever loaded with my Victims; and thou kind Nymph, who haſt thus crowned my hopes with comfort, ſhall find ſo true a love in this poor heart incloſed, that ſhall almoſt make thee think it worthy of thy accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Here <hi>Agenoris</hi> interrupted him: This is a day, ſaid he, that hath been filled with nothing but wonders, it ought to be ſolemnized for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving produced ſuch Miracles. Now, ſaid he, you are all happy— But I, who am, and yet muſt not and who may, and yet dare not. Ye Gods, how juſt are you, thus to allay my happineſs? Divine Princeſs, ſaid he, in directing his Speech to <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>candra,</hi> I do adore you, but it is an adoration that nothing equalleth, but that I pay to the Gods themſelves. The Princeſs was going to anſwer him, when <hi>Clarinda</hi> prevented him, by telling him, that doubtleſs what the Gods had done al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, they would complete, and therefore bid him not refuſe what they offered him: ſo after a ſmall pauſe; I am now going to let you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, ſaid ſhe, the occaſion of my being at Sea.</p>
            <p>My Father, as I told you before, is Governour of a Town in <hi>Creet,</hi> on whom King <hi>Porus</hi> hath conferred many other Offices, by which you may perceive, he was not a little beloved by that Prince, but one <hi>Polianor</hi> had inſinuated himſelf into the Kings favour, to that pitch, that he ſeemed among all the other Favorites at Court to be the beſt beloved, and being therefore one of no mean
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:54948:72"/>power, after he hd long courted me, under ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious pretences of Honour, to marry me, although by my cold entertaining him, he might have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned the averſion of my mind towards him, being one as deformed in Body, as low ſpirited in Soul, and one the baſeneſs of whoſe extraction did ſeem to dwell in his Phyſiognomy, his Birth being ſo far from Noble, that the meaneſt ſlave in <hi>Creet</hi> had more reaſon to brag of his extraction than he, becauſe he was raiſed meerly by the Kings favour; all his actions, which were ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom good, were winked at by the reſt of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, although it did not a little trouble them, to have a perſon ſo far beneath them, take place of them, with ſo much haughtineſs as he did. This Villain, I ſay, when he ſaw that I was deaf to his Courtſhip, when he ſeemed to careſs me under the mask of Honour, provoked by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous deſire, came at length to ſolicite me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfully, as if becauſe I would not ſubmit to him on virtuous terms, as he pretended, he ſhould think that I would abandon my Honour, and after a paſſion, painted and coloured with ſighs, he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his preſents to his aſiſtance, but he ſaw it did but make me more ſoornful, and he had no ſooner, on a certain day made ſome offers to me, that were indeed extremely rich, but I, in a fury, left him by himſelf, and from that time it was he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to conſpire my ruine, and to ſeek to get by force, what he could not obtain by merit; Luſt not Love provoking him to attempt what ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and his own ſpirit, had it any thing of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity in it, would never let him reſt till he had
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:54948:72"/>extinguiſhes a deſire ſo abhominable; but alas ſuch noble thoughts could never invade the mind of one whoſe Heart was like his Birth, filthy; for he was not only deſcended from the dregs of the People, but he was likewiſe unlawfully begotten: my Father had notice of his deſign, ſometime before he endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to put it in execution, and almoſt too late to have prevented it; for I being one day in a ſmall Wilderneſs ſcituated in the midſt of my Fathers Garden; <hi>Polianor,</hi> who had conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually his ſpies ready, being informed where I was, being as he thought a very fit place for him to execute his black deſign in, was preparing to come in to me, having procured a Key to the Door, which he had cauſed to be made on purpoſe; to execute with the more eaſe his deteſtable Enterprize: but my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being juſt before informed by ſome ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Friend of what he intended, came pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to me, and cauſed me to come into the Houſe; where being come, he gave me a Drink to fruſtrate the intent of <hi>Polianor,</hi> who had been in the Garden to ſearch for me, but not finding me, went out again very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied; and being come into the Town, was there informed by the Rumour my Politique Father ſpread, that I was dead; for the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of what I drank, procured me ſo great a ſleep, that it ſeemed to all Spectators, as no other than the Sleep of Death. <hi>Polianor</hi> being ſomewhat rerrified at this ſad News, came to behold it painted on my Face, and
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:54948:73"/>then a ſtrange remorſe quarreled with his luſt, and his deſpair, or rather rage, arm'd him to kill himſelf; but whilſt his Soul was troubled here withal, I was (being by Friends firſt dreſſed up in Mans Apparel, as you ſaw, for my better concealment) conveyed ſecretly into a Barck, and ſcarce had I finiſhed my ſleep, but at my firſt awaking, I found my ſelf upon the Sea; which I did not ſo much wonder at, as at my ſtrange Metamorphoſis from a Woman to a Man: but a Friend of my Fathers, whom he intruſted to take care of me, and who was on board, ſoon helped me out of that trouble; and after he had told me that we were ſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards <hi>Lydia,</hi> he related to me the whole Adventure, with the ſecret Impoſture of my fained Death; when ſuddenly a ſtorm broke the Diſcourſe, and Horror and Death marched upon the Waters, and as I before told you, drove us upon a Rock, and ſplit our Veſſel all to pieces, not far from theſe Coaſts: I doubt the Friend that was in the Bark with me, is drowned, I my ſelf, as you ſee, having miraculouſly eſcaped.</p>
            <p>I know not which of the Gods took care of me, but I cannot forbear to acknowledge how much I am indebted to <hi>Agenoris</hi> and <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damont,</hi> for preſerving my Life. My Father, who hath had no News of me ſince my Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival here, I fear doth imagine, as juſtly he may, that I am drown'd; and I was fearful to ſend, leaſt ſome unlucky accident or other might have brought my Letters into the Hands
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:54948:73"/>of <hi>Nearchus;</hi> who doubtleſs if he knew where I was, would make a general ſearch for me; that likewiſe was one reaſon that made me continue in this diſguiſe: but now ſince other Miſteries far ſtranger than theſe are revealed, and ſince <hi>Clidamont</hi> hath ſworn him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf mine, it were a vain thing for me to have concealed my ſelf longer: Having ended her Relation, they all, after they had returned her thoſe thanks, and given her thoſe praiſes, her Wit deſerved, departed one from another to take their Reſts, becauſe Night already be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſpread her Sable Curtains over them.</p>
            <p>The next morning, when the ſinging of the Birds had rowſed them up with their pretty Notes, they all agreed, both the Ladies and the Gentlemen, to walk to the Grove of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> there to entertain one another in the Lodge, that was on the top of the Labarinth; where they had not long enjoyed themſelves, by taking notice of the pleaſure of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect that was diſcerned from that place, but <hi>Agenoris</hi> told the Princeſs <hi>Alcandra,</hi> that he knew his mind did not diſagree with the reſt of the Company; for being deſirous to know how ſhe came to eſcape all thoſe dangers in which ſhe was, and that ſince the place was pleaſant wherein they were (he ſeconded by the reſt of the Company) beſeeched her to relate her Adventures, which without much intrearies ſhe did to this effect.</p>

               <p>HAd I all the Languages of the Gods, and had Eloquence to chuſe out my Voice to manifeſt her ſelf to Men, it is unpoſſible to expreſs the hundredth part of my ſufferings, when I was taken by <hi>Cleobalus,</hi> Captain of the Vagabonds of <hi>Latronia,</hi> and when I ſaw <hi>Agenoris</hi> lie dead in the Cave wherein we were locked; then was it that I began to think the Oracle was near fulfilled; for being in the power of the greateſt Savages in the Univerſt, in the midſt of Rocks and Deſarts, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſeen him ſlain, whom I may now ſay, I loved dearer than my own Life; it is not to be doubted that my grief could admit of any compariſon with common miſeries. I filled the Air and Forreſts with my Cries, and although death was the moſt aſſured remedy I could chuſe, I was loath to die by the hand of ſo cruel a Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter: he many times would importune me with his unlawful Suit; but ſeeing he could gain no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from my conſtancy, and that I was reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved rather to loſe my Life than my Honour, he dragged me through retired and lonely places, into ſolitary Deſarts, imagining by therein to take by force, what he could not obtain by intreaty; but the Gods did not forſake me in diſtreſs, for the King of <hi>Pyſidia</hi> coming then with a powerful Army upon the Town of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronia,</hi> Captain <hi>Decius,</hi> Kinſman to <hi>Dyoniſius,</hi> came with Twenty or Thirty Horſemen that
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:54948:74"/>way, juſt at the time when he was going to put in practice his pernicious enterprize; when I ſaw this Troop coming directly towards us, I began to hope for Death, to put a peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od to my miſeries, or to change my Maſter. <hi>Cleobalus,</hi> who took them to be ſome of his own gang, advanceth towards them; and very boldly asked them whither they went? But <hi>Decius</hi> imagining him to be one of thoſe that King <hi>Arcon</hi> had ſet upon, not knowing him to be the Governor of <hi>Latronia,</hi> approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, and encompaſſed him ſo cloſe, that he had only the leiſure to quit me, and draw his Sword.</p>
               <p>During this Combat, I ſtole away from the Crowd, becauſe the little Casket I brought with me from <hi>Cyprus,</hi> wherein were a great many Rich Jewels that were preſented to me by <hi>Agenoris,</hi> kept me from running; I hid it in a little thick Buſh, and covered it with ſome White Linnen, to the end I might know it again if I eſcaped. In the ſame inſtant I took my flight, but I had ſcarce got thirty paces from thence, when five or ſix Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of King <hi>Arcons</hi> Army, that were there in the Field, laid hold on me, and were going to evil uſe me; but <hi>Decius</hi> took me out of their Hands, and ſaid aloud, Since I was the firſt ſpoil that was taken, that they muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve me to be made a Victim to the Gods.</p>
               <p>They carried me then to the Lodgings of <hi>Dyoniſius,</hi> who commanded the Vant-guard of the Army, and ſhut me in a Chamber till

               <p>
                  <hi>Philander</hi> thought nevertheleſs, that time
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:54948:75"/>might ſweeten this Natural Obſtinacy that ſeemed to be in me, and that at length Love might ſoftly ſteal upon me; with this hope he carried me away to <hi>Pamphilia,</hi> where he had ſome acquaintance; but as we were paſſing along through a large Forreſt, to go to the Town of <hi>Pezga,</hi> which is near the Sea; we ſaw our ſelves encompaſſed by Ten of the Kings Guard, who were then purſuing a <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> Gentleman (as I know ſince) who had ſecret Intelligence in Forreign parts, and would endeavour to ſtir up the People to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel againſt their Legitimate Soveraign; and becauſe <hi>Philander,</hi> as they told us ſince, did much reſemble him, they ſeized upon us, and carried us to the King; but when they had examined him more nearly, they ſent him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain into his own Country without any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther trouble, and the Queen of <hi>Pamphilia</hi> ſtayed me in ſpight of him; having ſecretly underſtood that I was ſtolen away by him. I remained ſometime in this Kingdom, and can without vanity ſay, that there was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Cavallier nor Lady at the Court, but thought the ſight of me a favour: I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, I was aſhamed of receiving what I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved I ſo little deſerved in a Prince's Pallace, not onely becauſe I knew nothing in me, that could make me worthy of the leaſt Favour they ſhewed me in a Place of that Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor; but becauſe I knew how mean my Birth was; and though I had Apparel, and every thing elſe allowed me, that was truly Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:54948:76"/>yet I thought my ſelf ſtill in my Shepherdeſs Weed: and though I alſo ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſate on Cloth of Gold, I thought my ſelf as it were ſeated on a Swelling Bank of chearful Green; ſtill keeping my homely Flocks. But when I likewiſe thought on the Death of <hi>Agenoris</hi> (for I could not be perſwaded that he was alive) I was no more capable of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Contentment; I paſſed my dayes in perpetual Languiſhings, and every Object I ſaw offended my ſight.</p>
               <p>I entreated the Queen, then to permit me to go and end my days in <hi>Cyprus;</hi> there was then a Pilot in the Port of <hi>Necopolis,</hi> that was going towards <hi>Famaguſta;</hi> he put me under his protection, but it was to engage me in new misfortunes; for we were ſcarce got Forty Leagues from the Port, but a Pirate took our Veſſel and ſunk her, after he had taken all the Merchandize, and all thoſe that were in her out of her: I was carried Captive to the Iſland of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> and I eſcaped nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly loſing my Life there; for theſe Pirates have a Cuſtom to Sacrifice a Virgin to the God <hi>Neptune</hi> every time they go to make ſome Voyage, and as bad luck would have it, the lot fell upon me: but as if Fate would ſeem to contadict it ſelf, the Prieſt became deeply in Love with me; he hid me in the moſt retired place of his Lodgings, and chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my Habit, taking away every thing that he thought might render me remarkable; and when the day of the Sacrifice came, he took
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:54948:76"/>out of the Priſon a young <hi>Grecian</hi> Virgin, who had been taken about <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and for whom they were in hopes of a great Ranſome; he Apparelled her in my Cloathes and brought her to the Sea ſide, where ſhe was Sacrificed in my place.</p>
               <p>During the Ceremony, and knowing that every Body was gone to ſee the Spectacle, and that no Body could hinder me from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth, I took a Reſolution to run away, to deliver me from the ſlavery of ſo many <hi>Corſares;</hi> the effect did happily anſwer my expectations, I got clear of the Iſle of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> by favour of the Pirates themſelves, who ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me in an ill Habit and Equipage, for I diſguiſed my ſelf purpoſely, and did uſe all the Art I could, to make me ſeem homely and deformed; I got then to a Town in <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi> where I conſulted the Oracle, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood that <hi>Agenoris</hi> was alive, and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, that my Extraction was from Kings, and that the Birth of <hi>Agenoris,</hi> was not in the leaſt deſpicable: I likewiſe underſtood, that I ſhould find him in an Iſland very Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, ſcituated in the Eaſtern Parts of the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea. Theſe words gave me both Joy and Grief, I was glad of this happy News, but I knew not what Iſland the Oracle meant; I was nevertheleſs reſolved to ſail into <hi>Creet,</hi> as one of the moſt Flouriſhing Kingdoms in the <hi>Mediterranean;</hi> but not learning any News there of what I ſought, I embarked from the Town of <hi>Beau-port,</hi> to ſail here into <hi>Cyprus;</hi>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:54948:77"/>but to augument our Diſaſter, we were by a Tempeſt caſt upon the Coaſts of <hi>Syria,</hi> where the Pirate <hi>Martius</hi> concluded to render us miſerable, in robbing and depriving us of the richeſt things in the Ship where I ws em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked.</p>
               <p>This Priate, who was one of the Principal A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents of General <hi>Goudolo:</hi> ſeeing me as he thought a Beauty that did not diſpleaſe him, became in love with me; and after he had cauſed me to be dreſſed in the Richeſt Robes he had in the Veſſel, to obtain my Favour, he preſented me with a little Casket full of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Stones: I was very much aſtoniſht and confuſed when I ſaw this preſent, for I knew it to be the ſame Box that I had formerly hid on Mount <hi>Taurus,</hi> when <hi>Cleobalus</hi> was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by <hi>Decius;</hi> the ſame I mean, <hi>Agenoris,</hi> that you was pleaſed to honour me with, when I was ſo far from being a Princeſs, that I was below the ſcorn of the meaneſt ſubjects I have in <hi>Sicily;</hi> not being willing then to refuſe ſo precious a Gift, I began to ſeem compliant to his addreſſes, and to ſhew him ſome friendſhip; as if I had eſteemed my ſelf happy in having fallen into his hands: I came likewiſe to know that he had taken thoſe Riches from a Sea-rover, near the Iſland of <hi>Rhodes;</hi> and how he had taken <hi>Agenoris,</hi> and of the ſtorm that had broke teir Veſſels, and how that of all that he then poſſeſſed, he had onely ſaved that Box.</p>
               <p>I continued a while with him, and by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:54948:77"/>he hoped to Marry me, he uſed all the Careſſes and ſhewed me all the Civilities in the World. Notwithſtanding I lived in a continual fear, for I could not be perſwaded that <hi>Age<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noris</hi> had eſcaped ſo fierce a Tempeſt; he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſeeing Melancholly in my Countenance, to divert me, put me under the Tuition of his Nephew, while he purſued a <hi>Cyprian</hi> Veſſel, which he knew would ſtrait imbark from <hi>Cili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia</hi> for <hi>Cyprus;</hi> he commanded us to land in a ſmall Iſland that lies very near <hi>Tripoly,</hi> which by reaſon of the multitude of Green Shady Woods, that therein elevate their cloſe Branches, thereby cauſing therein a certain agreeable Solitude, does bear the name of Deſart; I remained there the ſpace of two days, during which time I enjoyed all the content that could be obtained by hunting; for the place being but very little frequented, whatſoever way I looked, I found ſubjects enough whereon to beſtow mine Arrows; but however fair I carrid my ſelf to the Nephew of <hi>Martius,</hi> I always endeavoured to wander to the Sea ſide, to try if I could diſcover any Veſſels wherein I might caſt my ſelf to go to <hi>Cyprus;</hi> for I imagined that <hi>Agenoris</hi> could be in no other part. In fine, while our Marriners were paſſing their times in debaucheries and drunkenneſs in their Tents, I at a diſtance diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned a Veſſel that came directly to the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſland; it was the ſame Prize they expected from <hi>Cilicia,</hi> which notwithſtanding the Artifices of <hi>Goudolo</hi> and <hi>Martius,</hi> did not omit to proceed in
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:54948:78"/>her Voyage. I preſently forſook their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, faining my ſelf to go a hunting, and came to the Sea ſide, juſt as thoſe of the Veſſel were landing; the Captain of the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, who thought not that <hi>Martius</hi> was ſo near him, was willing to remain there and refreſh himſelf: I recounted to him a part of my misfortunes, and begged of him, if he had any compaſſion of my miſeries, to retire me from this dangerous Labarinth, becauſe that the Pirates would not fail to purſue him; the Captain who thought himſelf to be in ſafety in this Iſland, began to think on what he had beſt to do, and preſſed his chief Mate on board, and hoiſed up Sails, and ſo ſteered away to our intended Port. We had not got far to Sea, but we ſaw our ſelves purſued by <hi>Martius</hi> with three Brigantines; notwithſtanding we at length out ſailed and loſt ſight of them, and arrived happily at <hi>Amathuſſa;</hi> where I was ſcarce landed (and having hired a youth to carry my things for me) but I overtook a Grave Ancient Man, the ſame that is now in our preſence; who preſently asked me, if I had lived long in this Iſland? I told him yes, and that I thought I was born here; Then pray Mad, am ſaid he, ſince you are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Countrey, let me implore the favour of you, to direct me to the place I ſhould go to (I remember I was once here before, but it is ſome years ſince, which is the greateſt cauſe that I cannot find my way; for time hath bred in me forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:)
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:54948:78"/>I am newly come from <hi>Sicily,</hi> near to a place called <hi>Regium</hi> in <hi>Italy;</hi> and becauſe I would not forget the Mans Name I came to ſeek, I have written it down; which is <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lintus.</hi> Here I interrupted him, and told him, it was the Old Shepherd <hi>Melintus</hi> he meant; I knew very well where he lived, for I called him Father: Pray Lady, ſaid he, what may I term your Name? I am called, <hi>Melliſſa</hi> ſaid I; then anſwered he, pulling off his Hat, and ſtanding bare, with the Page that waited on him, which I muſt confeſs did a little confuſe me; My buſineſs is of greater weight to you than him, the Gods have favoured me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond my expectation, by my thus happily meeting of you. Know then, proceeded he, and be not ſurprized, that you are no more a Shepherds Daughter, but a Princeſs, and of one of the greateſt Iſlands in theſe Seas, which is the place from whence I came; I mean <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily:</hi> I am come to eſtabliſh you in your Throne, and to deſire you to receive the Joys and Acclamations of your Subjects, who do as much long to ſee you, as they have been grieved to hear of your ſuppoſed Death. Thus far, added <hi>Melliſſa,</hi> I have told you of my Adventures, the reſt I will leave to <hi>Cleoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi> meaning the Ancient ſtranger, for that was his name: Then did <hi>Cleonidus,</hi> after a low obeiſance, proceed after this manner</p>
               <p>It were a folly, worthy Gentlemen, for me to go to prove by Arguments, that the Royal <hi>Alcandra</hi> is a Princeſs, ſince it is but obſerving
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:54948:79"/>her well, to find marks enough in her of greatneſs to reveal and prove what I now ſay: Give me leave to tell you, that ſhe was Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Brave Prince <hi>Hermicleus,</hi> King of <hi>Sicily,</hi> his only Child which he had by his Queen <hi>Selindra;</hi> who taking her farewel of the World, after ſhe had left him this dear Pledge, he was about contracting an Alliance with the <hi>Sardinians,</hi> by the Marriage of their Princeſs; but before it could be concluded, he ſickened, and was every moment in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of death; on his death-bed, then <hi>Cariſta,</hi> his Siſter-in-law, being with him, he made her Queen Regent, till <hi>Alcandra</hi> might be of an Age to ſway the Scepter her ſelf, and entreated her with the tears in his eyes to ſee her well educated in all the Vertues, Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments and Qualities of a high-born Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs; and after he had ſent for his chief Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors, and had upon their Allegiance charged them to obey <hi>Cariſta</hi> as Queen Regent, he peaceably in a deep ſigh departed; long had he not been dead, before the Queen Regent, whoſe towering thoughts could not brook a Co-partner with her in the Kingdom, and by whoſe Actions, ſhe ſeemed little to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded the dying Kings Words, as well by her Tyrannical Impoſitions, as by her Imperious Outrages on the Subject, ſhe was generally hated by all of them, who were ſeveral times about to revolt, had it not been for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration they had for the tender Princeſs; of whoſe innocent Life, ſhe ſeveral times did
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:54948:79"/>endeavour to bereave her, but by ſome ſtrange fate ſhe was always prevented; more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly once, when by ſome wicked caitiff ſhe had hired, a cup of Poyſon was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the Royal Babe, and the preſenter by ſome accident, having let it fall before it came to her Lips, a Dog being in the Room and licking it up, immediately after ſwelled and died. I was a beholder of this cruelty, and did not doubt but I alſo knew who was the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor; yet did I not dare to ſpeak my thoughts to any Body. The party that preſented the Poyſon to the Young Princeſs (for the Queen Regent was ſoon informed of it) though it were by her conſent, yet to take off any ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicion that might be of her, ſhe cauſed her to be publickly killed as a Traytor, ſeeming her ſelf to deteſt the deed and abhor the Actor: ſeeing then, that hitherto her wicked deſigns was ſpoiled, ſhe hatched one more new, no leſs to be abhorred than the former; for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made me her favourite, an honour truly which I was not very ambitious of; She would often be more free with me than with any in the Court beſides; I mean, as to the publiſhing of her thoughts; inſomuch that once, firſt with Money, joyned with all the Rhetorical Perſwaſions that Art can poſſibly manifeſt, to move the will and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, did ſhe endeavour to ſeduce me to murther the Princeſs; and having firſt made me to ſwear ſecreſie, which I did, I likewise told her, that it was an affair that required
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:54948:80"/>ſome time of conſideration before it was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; and therefore begged the permiſſion of her to grant me three days time to conſult upon it, which ſhe immediately did: but alſo failed not to put me in mind of my Oath of ſecreſie, which I alſo ſeemed to remember. Having had this time of conſultation, I ſoon took a reſolution in what I had to do, my deſign being in oppoſition to hers; to that end there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I reſolved to ſeem to comply with her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, as if I had purpoſed to deſtroy the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs; who now wanted near ſix months of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing three years of age: I viſited the Queen Regent then a ſecond time, after three days were expired; but before I could have time to open my mouth to tell her my reſolution, ſhe prevented me, by making larger promiſes to me than yet ſhe had done, if I would but execute what ſhe deſired; I told her, I had deliberated with my ſelf to obey her commands, and therefore would undertake to execute them; but I deſired to know of her in what manner ſhe ſhould have it done, whether by Poyſon, Steel, or Water? She told me ſhe had found out a way whereby I might do it without any danger, which was by Water: You muſt, <hi>Cleonidus,</hi> ſaid ſhe, hire a Barck, and privately take the Child, which I will procure you, and at no very ſmall diſtance from the ſhore, take<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a lump of Lead and tying it to her Neck, you muſt caſt her into the Sea; and when you bring me the news that you have obeyed me in every circumſtance, ſince I am the onely
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:54948:80"/>Succeſſor to the Crown after her deceaſe, to gratifie you, you ſhall by Marrying me, not only obtain the Name and Title of a King, but have alſo ſole command and power in this Iſland as a King: I ſeemed very ſubmiſſive to the promiſe of ſo large a gratification, and told her ſhe ſhould find me faithful; not to her I meant, but to this Illuſtrious Princeſs: I therefore took her privately, and went away to the Sea-ſide, imbarking in a Veſſel bound for <hi>Cyprus;</hi> having firſt taken ſome of the richeſt Jewels that belonged to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs's Mother, with all other things requiſite for ſuch a Voyage; where I was no ſooner landed, but I eſpied this Shepherd <hi>Melintus,</hi> who was keeping his ſheep.</p>
               <p>I carried the Child to him, and at length with Gold and fair words I made him receive it; which he did with much gladneſs, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the great quantity of Gold I gave him: the Jewels I deſired him to lay up, and ſeeing him to be a little ignorant, I gave them an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other name, pretending to ſlight their worth and value; he took them then, but was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed more with his Gold: I went with him to his Cabin, noted down his Name, and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him to let the Child go for his Daughter, and to give her the Name of <hi>Melliſſa:</hi> I alſo left a Mantle with him, which was extream coſtly, and wherein I had wrapped her up; that alone is enough to witneſs that the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to whom it belonged, was not to be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed common. After then I had remained two
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:54948:81"/>or three years longer in this Kingdom, and had began to take notice of thoſe Revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which were then beginning, and which did afterwards happen, by means of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuating Favorite <hi>Aphiſtaminus,</hi> who after the Prince <hi>Evagoras</hi>'s abſence and his Royal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Deceaſe, did unjuſtly poſſeſs himſelf more by force than favour, of this Iſland; cauſing rumors to be ſpread abroad that <hi>Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras</hi> was drowned at Sea. After, I ſay, I had with grief taken particular notice of all theſe things, and had given an expreſs order to <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lintus</hi> to ſee the ſuppoſed <hi>Melliſſa</hi> well educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and having ſupplied him with more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to do the ſame, after eight or ten years travel longer into other forrain parts, I chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to hear in <hi>Pamphilia</hi> that the Queen Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent of <hi>Sicily</hi> was dead; which immediately cauſed me to haſten thither: where when I was come, I found it to be true; but to my great amazement, after I came to Court I was laid hold on and clapt in Fetters: when I was brought to examination, glad was I to know the reaſon of it, which was, that the Queen Regent on her Death-bed (the Gods having ſtruck her with a ſenſe of her wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs), confeſſed that ſhe had hired me to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the young Princeſs; which ſhe ſaid ſhe believed I had done: and withal told them that were about her, that ſhe had ſeveral times her ſelf attempted it, but was always ſtrangely prevented. After I had been inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of all theſe particulars, before the chiefeſt
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:54948:81"/>of the Nation (who were all aſſembled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in order to my Trial) I making a Speech to them, told them, that all ſhe had acquainted them with was true; but the Murder ſhe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed me of, of which indeed I was not guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, though her intent made her appear to be ſo; and that abhorring her detéſtable Deſign, I had not executed her commands, but on the contrary had preſerved the Princeſs alive; who I told them I had conveyed to <hi>Cyprus:</hi> where ſhe was at preſent with an ancient Shepherd in quality of his Daughter. After I had made a Speech to them much after this ſort, no ſoul is able to expreſs the tokens of Joy they manifeſted at this News; they all immediately, inſtead of proceeding in my Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, with the tears in their eyes, came and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced me with all the love and tenderneſs that joyful hearts are capable of expreſſing. They preſently gave order for a Ship to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey me thither, that I might bring the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to them; they would have ſent out a whole Fleet, but that they thought it more prudence to have her brought privately: and therefore they as yet kept it from being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulged among the vulgar people. I asked them how it came they did not miſs the Princeſs when I was gone? They anſwered and told me, that <hi>Carista,</hi> ſometime after my departure, had cauſed a rumor to be ſpread that the young Princeſs was dead of a Feavor; and having ſubtilly cauſed a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of her to be caſt in Wax, ſhe had expoſed that to the view of moſt of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:54948:82"/>and had cauſed it to be buried in a moſt royal manner, and as became the Daughter of ſo great a Prince; to the general grief of the whole Nation: and that ſhe her ſelf, like a treacherous diſſembling Crocadile, did bear more outward ſhows of ſorrow than any; all which having indeed prevented them from ſuſpecting what they had moſt reaſon, ſhe was raiſed to the Throne.</p>
               <p>Thus have I informed you of all I know, but as to the further confirmation, when you ſhall arrive at the Caſtle, I ſhall ſend for <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lintus,</hi> who is the only perſon that can do it here; and now I deſire onely to execute my Commiſſion, in carrying her to her Loyal Subjects. Here the Princeſs interrupted him, and told him ſhe would firſt ſtay here two or three months, to the end ſhe might put her ſelf in an Equipage ſuitable to her quality; to which <hi>Cleonidus</hi> conſented. Then, ſaid ſhe, addreſſing her ſelf to <hi>Agenoris,</hi> It is to <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocles</hi> I am obliged, for bringing me to your preſence, who immediately after <hi>Cleonidus</hi> had overtook me, met us together; where af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had with much joy welcomed me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo ſurprized to find me in this habit; which is the ſame beſtowed me by the laſt Pirate that took me. He told me, that I muſt no more call him <hi>Theocles</hi> but <hi>Clarinda,</hi> for that was her Name; and withal related the Story of her love to me; how ſhe was intended to ſurprize them, by appearing before them all in that habit that ſuted beſt with her ſex; being
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:54948:82"/>reſolved to live in diſguiſe no longer: ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired me alſo to permit me to conduct her privately to the Caſtle, that we might both of us appear together. <hi>Agenoris</hi> and all the reſt that were preſent, were extreamly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at the recital of all theſe Adventures, yet in the midſt of all this cauſe of joy, a ſullen cloud ſeemed to dwell on the brow of <hi>Age<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noris,</hi> which did indeed leſſen a great part of it; he whiſpered to <hi>Clidamant,</hi> and told him, that now he ſhould loſe his Divine Princeſs, on whom he dare not look; ſince though he was a Prince, yet had he nothing to ſhew for it, but an empty Title. Ah Gods, why was I born, to be reduced to this miſery; yet what you have done is juſt, ſince you may have deſigned ſo admirably fair a Creature for one more worthy of her than my ſelf. <hi>Clidamant</hi> uſed all the expreſſions he could to comfort him, but it did put him the more in mind of his misfortune.</p>
               <p>Now they thought it was time for them to retire to the Caſtle, which they did, <hi>Agenoris</hi> conducting the Princeſs, <hi>Clidamant</hi> handing <hi>Clarinda,</hi> and <hi>Orontus Emilia;</hi> many days they all ſpent there with much diverſion, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept <hi>Agenoris,</hi> who could not diſſemble his ſorrow: they were all concerned for him, <hi>Alcandra</hi> her ſelf ſeemed intereſſed in it, but nothing could be available, ſince he thought himſelf ſo far beneath ſo great a Princeſs.</p>
               <p>On a certain day, when all the Company were aſſembled together in one of thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighful
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:54948:83"/>Green Arbors that are in the Tarras-walk in the Garden, <hi>Cleonidus</hi> ſent a Page for <hi>Melintus;</hi> who ſince he had loſt his ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Daughter, he very ſorrowfully retired from the Caſtle to his own Cottage in the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley; where he ſpent his time with leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent than he had done when ſhe was with him: for though he knew her not to be his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it may with truth be ſpoken, that no Parent ever ſhewed a more natural affection to their Child, than he did to this fair Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, all the time ſhe was with him; and was as much grieved for her ſuppoſed loſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Melintus</hi> came to the Caſtle immediately with the Meſſenger that was ſent for him; where when he came into the Arbor, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held a ſight which appeared ſo glorious to him, it raiſed a very deep aſtoniſhment in him; and the poor man had ſtill continued in it, had not <hi>Cleonidus</hi> come to him, and held this Diſcourſe, Friend, ſaid he, do you not remember that ever you ſaw a man like me? To which <hi>Melintus</hi> anſwered, after he had looked wiſhfully upon him, That the queſtion he asked he could not well anſwer; becauſe he was doubtful whether he did or no: yet he did ſuppoſe that he did ſome years ago ſee one that did very much reſemble him; but it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo long ſince, he could not well retain it in his memory. Then ſaid <hi>Cleonidus</hi> to him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, Had not you a Daughter? Yes, repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he, I had one that called me Father; and then proceeding and fetching a deep ſigh, But
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:54948:83"/>what? ſaid <hi>Cleonidus.</hi> She is no more, ſaid <hi>Melintus.</hi> Is ſhe then dead? ſaid the other. I fear it, ſaid he, for now the Sun has finiſhed and began anew his Orbicular Progreſs, ſince I laſt ſaw her. Upon this <hi>Cleonidus,</hi> by ſome tokens he gave him, cauſed him to call him to mind; and withal taxed him with negligence, in taking ſo little care for her: and at the length told him, that ſhe was a Princeſs, and that he muſt either preſently produce her or die. All the poor man's prayers and intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were in vain, to the ſeemingly-cruel <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onidus;</hi> which having his Sword drawn in his hand, ready as it were to pierce him to the heart with it. The fair <hi>Alcandra,</hi> who was ſeated upon a Bank of Flowers, roſe ſtrait up, and approaching the amazed <hi>Melintus,</hi> bad him be of good cheer; and told him he ſhould not die: and commanding <hi>Cleonidus</hi> to hold back his hand, bid the affrighted <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lintus</hi> look upon her, and ſee if he could know her. He had no ſooner caſt up his eyes, but by ſome token he found her to be his ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Daughter; and with tears of joy caſt himſelf at her feet, which he embraced. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had a little rallied upon the Old man for being thus concerned, <hi>Cleonidus</hi> with much ſweetneſs deſired him to fetch the Jewels and the Mantle he had left with him, when he put the young Princeſs into his cuſtody; tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him he ſhould have Gold in exchange for them. He failed not in all haſte to go for them, and was not long before he returned:
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:54948:84"/>which when he had ſhewed them to <hi>Agenoris</hi> and the reſt that were there, they were even dazled at the magnificence and richneſs of them: there was a Diamond among the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Jewels, which for the largeneſs and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the world could not produce one to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare with it. <hi>Cleonidus</hi> having performed his promiſe to <hi>Melintus,</hi> by giving him money in exchange for them, he went away with a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry joyful heart; bleſſing the day that ever he had had ſuch a Daughter as his ſuppoſed <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſſa</hi> was. I could not hear whether he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took himſelf to his old Vocation of keeping of Sheep, but certain I am, that the Old man was now rich enough to live without it. Scarce was he gone, when a Page comes to the Arbor to demand for <hi>Agenoris;</hi> who going to him, he with much ſubmiſſion delivered him a Letter: which having haſtily opened, he was much ſurprized to find it contain thus:

Many more obliging expreſſions paſſed between them to the ſame effect, and then they joyned again with the reſt of the company in the Arbor, who were all very curious to partake with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genoris</hi> in the Joy they ſaw in his Face, when he firſt approaching <hi>Orontus,</hi> and then <hi>Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> told them the real truth of what had happened; and then betaking himſelf to his place again, told them all aloud, that he had received an expreſs Order from <hi>Evagoras,</hi> who had raiſed another Army, and who was now in <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and not dead, as the Tyrant had reported, to attend him in the Battle he was going to fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Rebels, in the plain of <hi>Maſſara;</hi> and ſo deſired them all to be patient, till he came back again, for he doubted not but to return Victorious: they all were troubled to hear that he muſt again hazard his Life, more eſpecially <hi>Alcandra;</hi> who, though ſhe then ſpoke but indifferently againſt his going (as the reſt of the company) yet by the grief that appeared in her Viſage, her Heart ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be not a little intereſſed.</p>
               <pb n="155" facs="tcp:54948:85"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Clarinda,</hi> who helped to make up the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and who told the company, that ſhe had heard very much ſpoken in commendation of that Prince in <hi>Creet,</hi> and had heard there ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of his misfortunes, though but obſcure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: as alſo concerning the Tyrant, now reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Cyprus;</hi> but that ſhe never yet could hear by what means he came to poſſeſs the Throne, and therefore told them, if any of them could ſatisfie her curioſity in what ſhe now deſired, ſhe would take it as a ſingular Favour. <hi>Clidamant,</hi> who was ever ready to perform any command injoyned by her, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a few Complements, which are uſual on the like occaſions, began his Relation much after this ſort:</p>
               <p>The late King of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and Father to the preſent <hi>Evagoras,</hi> Indubitable Heir to the Crown, was a Perſon of a Diſpoſition very mild and ſweet, and beloved even by his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry enemies; his Son, the preſent Prince, not as then arrived to the third year of his Age, was by his Royal Father, deſigned, when he ſhould arrive to more mature years, to have him matched with the Princeſs of <hi>Sicily,</hi> which he ſuppoſed death ſometime afterwards put a period to: I need not ſpeak in praiſe, neither of her outward or inward Beauty, ſince with one only look upon her, as ſhe now Graces the Company, they may be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently convinced, that the firſt is more than Angelical; and by the long experience we even all have had of her Converſation, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:54948:86"/>not but know, that the later is Divine indeed. Here a deep Carnation, like the Sky, when painted with the bright beams of ſmiling <hi>Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus</hi> in a Summers morn, over-ſpread the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Face of this Princeſs; when <hi>Clidamant</hi> ſtill proceeded, ſaying, It being then gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally believed that this Princeſs was dead in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, <hi>Evagoras</hi> being almoſt arrived to theſe years, his Father expected, after he had cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him to learn all things neceſſary for a Prince, as well the managing the Horſe, breaking of the Lance, as other Souldierly Exerciſes, he wanted nothing now but Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel to render him exactly accompliſhed; though it cannot but be confeſſed that he ſeemed to want that the leaſt of any thing: and whatever he ſtudied, he alwayes arrived to that height, as even to out-do his very Tutors themſelves; ſo active and forwards was he to learn great things, when things indifferently mean, at his age, might have been eſteemed incomparable: What his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſigned, he ſoon put in execution; wherefore he took his laſt farewel of him at <hi>Nicoſia</hi> (laſt indeed, ſince it was the laſt time he ſaw him) and imbarking at <hi>Famaguſta,</hi> firſt ſailed towards <hi>Syria,</hi> thence to <hi>Cilicia, Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philia, Lydia, Morea,</hi> and other Countreys: He had not long been gone, when <hi>Aphiſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menus,</hi> who fled from <hi>Silicia</hi> ſometime before, for aſpiring higher than became him, and whom <hi>Evagoras</hi> knew not to be a little favoured by his Father, obtained of him by his ſubtil in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuations,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:54948:86"/>that ſince he had no Succeſſor but <hi>Evagoras</hi> to the Crown, that after his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe and his Sons, he would eſtabliſh him in the Cyprian Throne; and for the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe cauſed him to confirm it with his Great Signet: which he did, as judging he could not beſtow a Crown on one whom he loved more than this Ingrate. Some ſmall time after, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the abſence of the Prince, his Son, he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; charging his Nobles to eſtabliſh <hi>Aphiſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menus</hi> Protector of the Crown, till his Son re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned: which he at firſt managed with much ſeeming mildneſs, till a report was ſpread, by means of the Tyrant himſelf, that <hi>Evagoras</hi> was caſt away in the Straight of <hi>Charibdes:</hi> and then he ſwayed the Scepter with much Rigor and Tyranny, and cauſed himſelf to be proclaimed as King; proving himſelf, by means of the Great Seal and Writing he had from the late King, to be juſtly eſtabliſhed; and thus reigned with much ſeeming quietneſs, till the news reached the ears of <hi>Evagoras;</hi> who failed not with all ſpeed to come to <hi>Cyprus;</hi> though he was no ſooner come, but he found all things in combuſtion; the Tyrant having raiſed forces to withſtand his Arrival, becauſe he had made thoſe that were his true Subjects, believe him to be an Impoſtor and a Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit <hi>Evagoras;</hi> and one whoſe aim was ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: upon which enſued ſeveral bloody Battels between this Prince and the Tyrant; though the fate of War, which every body knows to be uncertain, did always, by reaſon of his
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:54948:87"/>numbers, render the Tyrant more fortunate; inſomuch that in the laſt Battle the Prince fought, who though he behaved himſelf ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry gallantly, and like one that contemned Death for Glory. The too great numbers of the Tyrants men, conſtrained him to retreat; and at length finding it difficult to raiſe more forces, he retired, as they reported, into <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily;</hi> where he is forced to remain deprived of his Kingdom by one his Father loved. Then ſaid he, addreſſing himſelf to <hi>Clarinda,</hi> Thus Madam, has my willing obedience to this ſmall command, made you, I hope, in ſome meaſure ſenſible how much I ſhould think my ſelf honoured to receive greater from you. <hi>Clarinda</hi> anſwered his Complements wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily enough, and could not forbear to lament the miſerable fate of this Prince. <hi>Orontus</hi> proffered his ſervice to <hi>Agenoris,</hi> but he would by no means let him go; telling him that he had permitted <hi>Clidamant</hi> to go with him: and that he muſt remain behind, to entertain the Ladies in their abſence; who would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe take it as a diſobligement, to deprive them of all their company. <hi>Emilia,</hi> who at firſt began to be concerned at what <hi>Orontus</hi> had demanded, was now ſenſibly pleaſed, when ſhe underſtood that <hi>Agenoris</hi> would not grant his requeſt. But <hi>Clarinda</hi> was ſtruck with a damp that had like to have made her ſwound away, when ſhe heard ſhe muſt loſe the preſence of her <hi>Clidamant,</hi> ſhe imagined ſhe ſhould never ſee him again; but when he
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:54948:87"/>was dead: however there could be no other Remedy found for her but patience. At length when they were preparing to leave the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, to walk into the Houſe, <hi>Agenoris</hi> ſingled out the Princeſs, and walking with her into a little Wilderneſs of Sycamore Trees, that was at one ſide of the Garden; he firſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaled his Lips to her in this manner:</p>
               <p>Illuſtrious Madam, I am now going to leave the only object I love in the World. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, Divine Lady, that word, that eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped my Lips at unawares; for not being in a capacity to deſerve you, you may with ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice eſteem me a Criminal for pronouncing it: Let me carry with me then but the eſteem and well-wiſhes of your Royal Self in exchange, and I am made the happieſt of men. I dare not crave more, though I deſire more; I ſhall likewiſe then queſtion not but to return more than Conqueror. You may imagine, Madam; that my Birth is mean (too mean, I confeſs, now to merit your love) yet I may boldly ſay that it is almoſt equal with yours; for he that now ſpeaks to you, he that hath lived thus long in private, is that diſconſolate Prince <hi>Evagoras,</hi> robbed of his Kingdom, abuſed by an Impoſtor, and believed by his ſubjects to have no living. Being it is I, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, then, that am going to obtain what may make me more deſerving of you than I am at preſent; You have a flouriſhing Kingdom under your power, but alas! I am diſabled from preſenting you with this ſmall Iſland,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:54948:88"/>which was once under my Fathers; and till I am in poſſeſſion of it, I dare not Madam preſume to think I love you. Your Diſcourſe, ſaid <hi>Alcandra,</hi> though it be ſurpizing, ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth me but little; ſince I have been every moment ready to ſuſpect what you tell me: for I ever thought you could be no leſs than a Prince by your obliging Actions and Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. Let me likewiſe tell you, That Love founds ſo pleaſingly in your mouth, that I could never be weary of hearing you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce it. I have not loved you ſo long, as to diſown it now; more eſpecially when I find your Birth not to be inferiour to mine: I were ingrateful if I ſhould. Love then, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sir, and love for ever her, whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant love to you, Time never ſhall extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh.</p>
               <p>But then proceeded ſhe, with a lamentable languiſhing look, and preſſing his hand with a Lovers extaſie, Muſt you, muſt you leave me? ah! Can you leave me, that loves you as I do? hard Fate! What comfort do you think I can find in your abſence, and when I know you to be expoſed to all the perils that ſharp pointed Swords, murdering Lances, and conſuming Arrows, are like to make you endure; ah! ſaid ſhe, putting her Handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief before her Eyes; I ſhall ſink beneath the weight of ſuch a loſs.</p>
               <p>Madam, ſaid <hi>Evagoras,</hi> Theſe ſweet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions have revived my drooping heart, and having you on my ſide, I do not que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:54948:88"/>Victory. Deareſt Princeſs, were it not more for my Honour, and the Love I bear you, than for my Right, I would not, nay I could not leave you.</p>
               <p>Generous Sir, ſaid <hi>Alcandra,</hi> ſince I ſee you to be reſolute then in your purpoſe, go, and may you return Victorious, may all things anſwer my wiſhes to compleat your happineſs, and may the Gods proſper you; but added ſhe, ſpeaking more low, however, forget not her you have left behind in the midſt of dangers; blot not <hi>Alcandra</hi> out of your minde.</p>
               <p>No, ſaid he, with a deep ſigh, the thought of her will ſpur me on to Victory, which I hope will be ſpeedy, that I may haſten my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn; too morrow then Madam, I will take my farewel of you, till then I ſhall not; ſo tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the freedom of a ſalute, which ſhe did not in the leaſt refuſe him; they both returned to the Caſtle.</p>
               <p>Many tender expreſſions of the like nature paſſed between <hi>Clidamant</hi> and <hi>Clarinda,</hi> whoſe eyes were all in tears at the thoughts of it. <hi>Clidamant</hi> revealed his right name to her, and told her how he was a Lord that lived in the Court of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and had followed the Prince <hi>Evagoras</hi> in his misfortunes; and that ſhe muſt no more eſteem <hi>Agenoris</hi> as a private Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, but as that Prince he ſpoke of not long ſince; becauſe it is really him. <hi>Clarin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> was much aſtoniſhed at this news, though ſhe ſaid he had not carried himſelf ſo like a private Gentleman, but that there were
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:54948:89"/>ſome marks of greatneſs in him that were vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Evagoras</hi> and <hi>Coriander,</hi> for ſo we muſt now call them, having fitted themſelves with Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor and all other neceſſaries for their Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick Enterprize, they were preparing on the morrow to go; but when <hi>Evagoras</hi> was taking his leave of the Princeſs, ſhe wept ſo bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that her exceſs of grief would ſcarce give her tongue the freedom of pronouncing the word <hi>Adieu;</hi> and <hi>Clarinda</hi> inſtead of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Coriander,</hi> ſwounded away, and was carried in by her Attendants. They both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well mounted on two incomparable Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, <hi>Evagoras</hi> firſt having kiſſed the lips of his dearly beloved Princeſs, gallopp'd away (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving each of them an Eſquire to attend them) with an excellent grace. To have ſeen with what a reſolution they departed, it would even have moved pity and aſtoniſhment; the firſt to have obſerved how ready they were to ſacrifice themſelves on Honours Shrine, the other to remark the greatneſs of their courage. It is to be imagined that in all the time of their abſence the two Lovers <hi>Alcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dra</hi> and <hi>Clarinda,</hi> had but very little enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of themſelves. Often did the Prince write to <hi>Alcandra,</hi> and as often did <hi>Clarinda</hi> hear from <hi>Coriander;</hi> which in the midſt of this cruel affliction, afforded them ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. The laſt Letter they received, was that the two Armies were going to engage; and that as ſoon as the Battle ſhould be ended,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:54948:89"/>they would make all poſſible ſpeed to return to them again.</p>
               <p>The firſt ſeemed to pierce their very hear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s for the apprehenſion they were in for thoſe they loved; yet their hope for the ſecond was as a ſalve to heal the wound their fear occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned. Inſomuch that the two paſſions of hope and fear ſeemed wholly to occupy them during the abſence of <hi>Evagoras</hi> and <hi>Coriander. Emilia,</hi> who though ſhe was touched with ſome regret for the abſence of them both, yet the preſence of her <hi>Orontus</hi> over-powered all; for her countenance was more chearful, her behaviour more jovial, and her heart more light than the reſt: and indeed her ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity and chearfulneſs would ſometimes ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh thoſe ſullen thoughts which over-bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanced the minds of the other two Ladies. She would endeavour to infuſe into them the Cordial of Comfort, and to that end would cauſe them ſometimes to take the Air with her in the Fields: Eſpecially one day the three Ladies being in a Coach, and <hi>Orontus</hi> on Horſe-back (which was ſome conſiderable time after the departure of <hi>Evagoras</hi> and <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riander</hi>) when paſſing thorow a deſolate For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, they eſpied a Horſe running very faſt croſs it, with a man that lay on the ground all in blood as if he was dead; they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently curious to ſee this Spectacle, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the Ladies preſently deſcended from the Coach, and <hi>Alcandra,</hi> who approached it firſt, ſaw that he was indeed dead. <hi>Orontus,</hi>
                  <pb n="164" facs="tcp:54948:90"/>who had a deſire to know the original cauſe of this Maſſacre, advanceth a little forward, and at a diſtance he faw three men fighting very deſperately with a young Lord; who although he defended himſelf with much cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and valour, yet did they preſs him with ſo much advantage, that he was to expect nothing but Death. <hi>Orontus</hi> preſently hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, immediately drew his Sword, and gallopped directly towards them; but he came not time enough to preſerve the Lord from two wounds he received, the one in his left Arm, the other a little beneath the right Shoulder; <hi>Emilia</hi> and the other Ladies (there being nothing more timerous than this Sex) fearing leaſt ſome misfortune might happen to <hi>Orontus,</hi> endeavoured to call him back as loud as they were able: but as they came near to the dead body, and ſaw him lie in that manner, <hi>Alcandra,</hi> whether ſhe ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſomething, or whether ſhe was deſirous to ſee his face, out of curioſity lifted up his Helmet (for he was in Armor) and finding it to be <hi>Evagoras,</hi> O gods, ſaid ſhe, what diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal ſpectacle do I ſee here? Is it then thou Dear Life of my Soul? May the day thou departed from us be for ever accurſed: May the Sun on that day never ſhew its glorious Light; and may it be for ever blotted out of the yearly Regiſter. Oh my heart, why doſt thou not break? that I may go with my <hi>Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras</hi> to the Celeſtial Paradiſe. Muſt I ſtay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind when he is gone? No, my Dear, in
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:54948:90"/>ſhining rayes of light we'll meet each other; and ſince we could not here enjoy the fulneſs of Love, we'll intermingle ſouls in the other world, and enjoy more ſweets in our Ethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Beings, than dull heavy Mortals can ever comprehend: There will our lives be never croſſed by fears, nor into black deſpair our hopes ſhall never turn; through the warm ſmiling beams of the bright Sun we'll gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly glide, and therein amorouſly ſport and play; till on a ſudden we find our ſelves wrapt in the heavenly Manſions. Then addreſſing her ſelf to the Corps, But art thou then dead <hi>Evagoras?</hi> Muſt thy Eyes be for ever ſhut? It is <hi>Alcandra</hi> that calls thee, it is <hi>Alcandra</hi> that bemoans thee; and who, if thou art now not dead, will before thou dieſt render thee eternal teſtimonies of her Love. At the name of <hi>Alcandra, Evagoras,</hi> who was in a ſwound, by reaſon he had loſt much blood; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the blows he had received, as well in the Battle as in this rencounter (for his Armor was pierced in ſeveral places) wakes, as from a dead ſleep; and opening his Eyes, which the ſleep of Death ſtill kept half ſhut; and beholding <hi>Alcandra,</hi> Is it thou then, my Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Princeſs, that thus did call me? ſaid he, Thou lovely fair, give me then thy precious hand to kiſs; which hath ſo often touched mine. O happy Deſtiny, what Divinity am I now obliged to for this favor? Now I find my wounds are not ſo bad (except it be that pleaſing one which your eyes have given my
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:54948:91"/>heart:) ſince fortune has reſerved me in my diſtreſs for ſo happy a rencounter. By this time the two Combatants were come back again with Victory (for two of the Ruffians they killed, and the other ran away) but both of them grievouſly wounded, eſpecially the young Lord, who was <hi>Coriander;</hi> which did very much afflict <hi>Clarinda,</hi> and doubtleſs had it not been for <hi>Orontus, Coriander</hi> would never have eſcaped their fury; for they would have murdered him. The wounded Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were all put into the Coach, except <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rontus,</hi> whoſe wounds were not ſo dangerous as thoſe they had received. <hi>Evagoras</hi> and <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riander</hi> then being in the Coach with the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, <hi>Alcandra</hi> permitted the firſt to lay his head in her boſome, while ſhe tore her deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate hair and apparel to cover his wounds till ſhe came to the Caſtle. <hi>Coriander</hi> laid his head in his <hi>Clarinda</hi>'s lap, who did the like for him. Being arrived at their journeys end, the firſt thing they did to them, was to let them blood immediately; to the end they might by the inciſion of a Vein ſtanch the blood that came from their wounds: and then applying to them all requiſite remedies, they let them repoſe till the next morning; when they found ſtrong ſymptomes in them of a ſpeedy recovery. <hi>Coriander</hi> was firſt healed, and whether Nature were more powerful, or whether the preſence of <hi>Alcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dra,</hi> was the particular remedy, which was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough, <hi>Evagoras,</hi> by the help of his Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeons,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:54948:91"/>was healed beyond common ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation.</p>
               <p>Being all now in good health, well and free from all the dangers they were in, <hi>Alcandra</hi> was deſirous to know of them the occaſion of this laſt accident, and how fortune had favoured them in their firſt deſign? As we could deſire, ſaid <hi>Coriander,</hi> for heaven hath bleſſed us with Victory; though it hath coſt ſomething dear. Had you but ſeen with what a courage the brave <hi>Evagoras</hi> fought, you would have thought him more than humane; for his very looks terrified the enemies where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he appeared: I, who had the command of the left Wing, which conſiſted in about Two thouſand Horſe, my men ſome ran away, and the reſt ſtood ſtill, to be killed like Sheep by my ſide; the fury of the enemy having a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed them ſo, that they could deal no blows: in ſo much that the left Wing was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt routed, when the brave <hi>Evagoras,</hi> who had ſoon notice of it, came but with four hundred Horſe, and poured upon them ſo couragiouſly, that in a ſhort time he put a whole Body of Five thouſand men to the rout, with but a handful; though at the firſt he changed horſes no leſs than three times, for ſo often were they killed under him: I muſt attribute that more to your prudence and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, ſaid <hi>Evagoras,</hi> than to any thing you can call courage in me: but alas what you have done, does ſurpaſs all you can ſay of me: Did you not, when I was ſurrounded and ready to
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:54948:92"/>be ſlain or taken by the Uſurpers men, did you not like Lightning breaking down, and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all thoſe that ſtood to oppoſe you, reſcue me from them with a great ſlaughter of their men: That was a thing, ſaid <hi>Coriander,</hi> which not only my duty obliged me to do, but it was wrought by the power of the Gods, who conſidered the Juſtice of our Cauſe; they are ever the Protectors of Princes who are Earthly Gods, as they themſelves are Heavenly; however it was to your great cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage we owe this Victory, ſince it was by you only it was atchieved; therefore, Royal Sir, let us confeſs that the glory of the day was wholly due to you: And now Madam, ſaid he, in directing his ſpeech to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, we may preſume to think him worthy of your Illuſtrious ſelf; he hath ſince often confeſſed to me that the thoughts of you it was that inſpired him with that courage, and in fine, Madam, we have compleated what we went for; for ſo ſoon as <hi>Aphiſtamenus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſee himſelf worſted, he betook him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to flight with no more than a hundred Horſe; for beſides what were killed on the Enemies ſide, the reſt when they ſaw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the condition they were in, begged quarter of our Royal General, and came o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to our ſide; we left <hi>Periander</hi> in purſuit of him, and we have ſince heard, that he hath blocked him up in a little Town which is not well fortified, and where I am certain he cannot well eſcape: whereupon having
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:54948:92"/>commanded him to take the Tyrant either dead or alive, we left him, and deſired him afterwards to come to us as ſpeedily as he could, when he had ſetled all things in order, and to publiſh an Act of Pardon in the Name of the Prince for what had paſſed; but in our way thorow yonder Forreſt, we found our ſelves beſet by an Ambuſcade of Rogues, whoſe deſigns was to trepan us as we came from the Army; they were ſome of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies Party, who having notice of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that way, determined to kill both the Prince and us; and there <hi>Evagoras</hi> had like to have loſt his life, after the danger he had run in the Battle, till the brave <hi>Orontus</hi> lucki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly came to our aſſiſtance: Is the loſt <hi>Perian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> found then? ſaid <hi>Emilia;</hi> Yes Madam, ſaid <hi>Coriander,</hi> though not cured of his love; for when he went from hence, as he told me himſelf; being a thouſand times ready to kill himſelf for your cruelty towards him, he thought of a more Noble way to loſe his life, which was by redeeming his Prince and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try from the inſupportable Yoke of an Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: And Madam, I believe he hath perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his promiſe to himſelf, for his wounds are ſo dangerous, that nothing but death will cure them; he bad me tell you, that he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped you have not baniſhed your Friendſhip from him, though you have your Love; and that if you will beſtow on him the firſt, he will, if his wounds will let him live ſo long, come and have the ſatisfaction to die in your
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:54948:93"/>preſence. This, Madam, he bid me tell you, and <hi>Evagoras</hi> hath given order to a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

I could not, yet I had that Friendſhip for him, that I wiſh he may live: I wiſh no harm to my very Enemies, added ſhe, and I have leſs reaſon to rejoyce at his death who hath thus ſerved his Prince and Countrey; and truly, to have him die for my ſake, would grieve me.</p>
               <p>Old <hi>Cleonidus,</hi> who underſtood all theſe tranſactions, was extreamly pleaſed at the ſurprizing news of <hi>Agenoris</hi> being a Prince, and that he adored the Princeſs <hi>Alcandra;</hi> and much more was he ſatisfied, when he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood how near he was being eſtabliſhed in the <hi>Cyprian</hi> Throne; he thought that this would raiſe both joy and admiration in the hearts of the <hi>Sicilians,</hi> and that this Alliance could not chuſe but be agreeable to them: wherefore he preſently diſpatched Letters to the Nobility and Council, wherein he at large laid open to them the advantages that would accrue to that Iſland by this happy Marriage. We muſt imagine it did not diſpleaſe them; many days were ſpent in the Caſtle with much diverſion; there were Balls, Plays, Dances, and every thing elſe that could be grateful to the Senſes; and now <hi>Evagoras</hi> began to think on nothing more than the Celebration of their Nuptials; he was reſolved they ſhould all contribute to the joys of that happy day: But
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:54948:93"/>notwithſtanding, he imagined it neceſſary to wait the arrival of <hi>Periander,</hi> who he doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed would not live to ſee their joys compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which grieved him exceſſively, for he had a particular love for him; nay, not only he, but all the reſt of the Company (who were at that time altogether in an upper Room, where the Windows faced the Myrtle Grove) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed their ſorrow for the loſs of ſo brave a man, they were thus pittying him for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate wounds he received in the Battle, when a glorious ſound of Trumpets ſurprized them ſo, that they were in great apprehenſion what it might mean; when the Prince <hi>Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras</hi> running to the Window to ſee who they were, immediately called the Princeſs, and the other Ladies, to ſee ſomething curious, which was eight Trumpeters repreſenting the <hi>Zephi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;</hi> for they were in Cloſe-bodied Coats of Fleſh-colour'd Sattin, and Wings on their Shoulders, being all mounted on Horſes cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed in green Velvet, and beſpangled with Gold; having each of them in their hand a Silver Trumpet: They had not looked on them much longer, but they alſo eſpied a great body of Horſe, that planted themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Trumpets and the Wood in Battle Array: ſoon after that they eſpied a Litter, which made up to the Caſtle; and then the Trumpeters ceaſing to ſound, there was a great ſhout heard from among thoſe Horſemen that were in a body, and the Trumpeters, which was plainly underſtood to be, <hi>Long live
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:54948:94"/>Evagoras, King of Cyprus;</hi> they never ceaſed crying, but always redoubled it with the greateſt expreſſion of joy imaginable, throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up their Hats and claping their Hands. After this they heard a noiſe as if ſome body was coming up the ſtairs, but they came ſo ſoftly as if they deſpaired to reach the top of them; at length they eſpied <hi>Periander,</hi> lead in by a couple of Commanders, who by means of the loſs of Blood, and the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of his Wounds, was reduced to the condition of not being capable to ſtand upon his Limbs without ſome help; being entered the Room, they cauſed a ſeat to be brought to him to repoſe on, and they were all griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly afflicted to ſee him ſo dangerouſly wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but at length, as well as he was able, he told the Prince, that now he had done his duty, he ſhould die contented; for die ſaid he, I ſhall, and of theſe Wounds, my Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeons have given me over; I am glad ſaid he, bowing to the Prince, to hear of the choice you have made of this Illuſtrious Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, and ſaid he, I have left all things in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good order at <hi>Nicotia,</hi> for the reception of you both, and have brought here five hundred Horſe with me, to conduct you to the plain of <hi>Maſſara,</hi> where will meet you no leſs then twenty thouſand joyful <hi>Nicoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> to welcome you to your own: I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo imployed all the ingenious Artiſts that I could hear of far and near, to make all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of things to divert you with, when you ſhall arrive thither.</p>

               <p>For <hi>Aphiſtamenus,</hi> I have blocked him up in a place of little ſtrength, with about 8000 men, he having with him not above four hundred, when he ſent me word that he would deliver himſelf up upon theſe terms, That I would ſpare his life, and not put him in Irons; having a while conſidered on what he propoſed, I ſent him word, I would agree to the Article; which I did, for as ſoon as I had him in my power, not to break my word with him, I cauſed him to be bound in Chains of Silver, where he lies in a Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon in <hi>Nicotia,</hi> and where he is to expect the ſentence you will pronounce upon him; I ſhall not, ſaid <hi>Evagoras,</hi> break the promiſe you made him, which was to ſpare his life; but ſhall ſend him over Captive into <hi>Syria.</hi>

                  <hi>Periander</hi> had not been many days at the Caſtle, but he grew ſtill worſe and worſe, all the Arts the Chyrurgeons uſed to cure him were not able, but they told <hi>Evagoras,</hi> that he was a dead man, and that it lay not in their power to do him any good; but they would continue with him as long as he had life. <hi>Evagoras</hi> told them, That if they cured him, whatſoever they asked of him, upon the word of a Prince, they ſhould have; but nothing would do, ſince now that fatal hour was come: The Prince wept bitterly, their exceſs of joy was changed into exceſs of ſorrow, nothing but wringing of hands, and mourning was the product of his death; he told <hi>Emilia,</hi> who was preſent when he died, as
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:54948:95"/>were the reſt of the Ladies and Gallants, That ſince ſhe had refuſed him her love, when he was living he beſeeched her not to deny him her friendſhip now he was dying. <hi>Emilia</hi> told him, No, he had it and ſhould have had more when he lived, had it lain in her power to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow it. Thus, and much after this ſort, they diſcourſed with him, till he ſurrendered what he was indebted to Nature; his Body was ſoon ſent to <hi>Nicotia,</hi> there to remain till the King and Queen ſhould make their publick entrance, which they ſoon after did: The five hundred Horſe which was commanded by <hi>Orontus,</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended on them to the plain of <hi>Maſſera,</hi> where they joyned with Twenty thouſand <hi>Nicotians,</hi> who had notice of their coming, and who brought with them a Chair, for the King and Queen to make their publique entrance into the City: It was four ſquare, and drawn by eight White Horſes, and garniſhed with Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en Trophies; on the ſides upon the Pedeſtal, were twelve Columns that ſupported two Crowns of Gold, and at the upper end ſate the King and Queen; which were the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Ornaments there, for the people were raviſhed with beholding them, eſpecially the Queen, whoſe Beauty and ſmiling Innocence, drew not only their amazed eyes on her, but their hearts to honour and reſpect her as a Princeſs worthy of their love; the throng was not ſmall to come to a ſight of her; they that could enjoy that happineſs, they thought they enjoyed a bleſſing, that none but the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:54948:95"/>Gods themſelves were capable of beſtowing on them.</p>
               <p>Something lower than them ſat a <hi>Venus,</hi> hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in one hand a lighted Torch, and in the other a Bow and Arrows of <hi>Cupid;</hi> beneath her two little Children, and ſomething lower two <hi>Cupids</hi> at a great diſtance; before the Chariot marched twelve Horſes, every one led by two Slaves; the Horſes were harneſſed with Orange-coloured Sattin, edged with Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; the Slaves were habited in Cloth of Silver, the Livery of the <hi>Perſians:</hi> Then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed ſix Pages in Orange-colour'd Sattin, imbroidered with Silver, mounted on Horſes covered with the ſame: Then followed <hi>Oron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> at the Head of his five hundred men, who ſeparated from the <hi>Nicotians</hi> when they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the City, becauſe they planted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on both ſides the Streets to honour their entrance; he having led up his five hundred men; then followed this Chariot, on both ſides of which rode ſix of the chiefeſt Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: Then appeared <hi>Coriander</hi> at the Head of four hundred more of the Nobility in bright glittering Armour, which by the reflection of the Sun beams upon them, was a moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous object to behold: I am not able to paint out the Magnificence of this day, equal to what it was; being arrived at the Palace-Royal with the joyful Acclamations of <hi>Long live</hi> Evagoras <hi>and</hi> Alcandra, <hi>King and Queen of</hi> Cyprus <hi>and</hi> Sicily. <hi>Evagoras</hi> thought it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite before the Celebration of his Nupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:54948:96"/>and Coronation, to have the Body of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riander</hi> interred with that Magnificence he had deſerved when he lived, which was alſo accordingly done, with no mean coſt and ſplendour; after which they began to think of Celebrating their Nuptials, which was likewiſe ſome days afterwards performed with all the glory that can be imagined, and to the no mean ſatisfaction of all theſe Lovers. This day was of far greater ſplendour than the day of the Princes entrance into the City, for there were Tilts and Turnaments, break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Lances, and every thing elſe that might conduce to the pleaſure of ſuch a day. There were likewiſe already many Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours arrived from ſeveral parts beyond the Seas, to complement <hi>Evagoras</hi> from Forreign Princes, touching his happy arrival to his long loſt Throne: Among the reſt, there came ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of the <hi>Sycilian</hi> Nobility to acknowledge <hi>Evagoras</hi> their King, by reaſon of the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age to the Princeſs <hi>Alcandra,</hi> and who bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Gods for beſtowing on them ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent a Prince as was <hi>Evagoras.</hi> There was an other ſtrange Embaſſadour at Court among the reſt, who was always looking very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly on <hi>Clarinda,</hi> who took as much notice of him till once approaching her: Pray Madam, ſaid he, vouchſafe me the favour of your Name, for if my eyes deceive me not, I ſhould know you: My Name Sir, ſaid ſhe, looking wiſtly upon him, is <hi>Clarinda;</hi> then cryed he out, running to her, and imbracing
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:54948:96"/>her with the tears in his eyes, Oh my dear Daughter, have I found thee! Oh happineſs beyond expectation! Gods, ſaid <hi>Clarinda,</hi> in as great a Rapture as he, I think it is my dear Father <hi>Meander,</hi> who I forſook in <hi>Creet</hi> by the unhappy means of <hi>Polianor.</hi> Being both come to themſelves, <hi>Meander</hi> told her he believed ſhe was drowned, but that to his unexpreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible joy he now found to the contrary: and then ſhe begg'd his pardon for marrying without his conſent, and told him to whom ſhe was now a Bride; which redoubled the old mans joy: Pardon, ſaid he, it is I muſt beg your pardon for expoſing you to theſe dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers you now have eſcaped; and withal told her, that <hi>Polianor</hi> died mad; and now, ſaid he, my grey hairs will receive new vigour: Heavens proſper you my dear Daughter in your happy choice (ſaid he.) This <hi>Meander</hi> was Father to the pretended <hi>Theocles,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Favourite of the King of <hi>Creet,</hi> was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſent over as an Embaſſadour to complement <hi>Evagoras.</hi> The Forenoon was ſpent in Tilts, Turnaments, and ſuch like Heroick Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; the Afternoon they diverted themſelves in the Palace-yard, which was all ſurrounded with Scaffolds for the Spectators, at the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per end whereof was that where the King, Queen, <hi>Orontus, Emilia, Coriander,</hi> and <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinda</hi> ſtood: Next to them, on the right hand were placed all the Forreign Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours, on the left hand was ſome of the <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi> Nobility; and thus was the Palace-yard
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:54948:97"/>ſilled all round about with all ſorts of people: in the midſt of the Yard was built a ſtately Palace, which was termed the Palace of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; it was flanked with four ſquare Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and with one ſomething longer than the reſt in the middle, upon which was built a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother leſs, having eight Angles; the Gate was adorned with four Pillars, upon the front of which was carved this Motto, <hi>To the joy of the Publick:</hi> At the Gate were repreſented the four Cardinal Vertues, and a little higher <hi>Castor</hi> and <hi>Pollux,</hi> for an Emblem of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of theſe two Crowns: upon the four fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Tower, in the middle, was figured four great Images; the firſt was <hi>Felicity,</hi> the ſecond <hi>Hercules,</hi> the other <hi>Horcuis,</hi> the God of Oaths, and the laſt <hi>Fidius,</hi> the God of Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity; on the two Towers, to the right hand, was placed four others; that is to ſay, <hi>Peace, Concord, Truth</hi> and <hi>Hymen:</hi> All the Spectators being then ranged in order to behold the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſight, ſome behind the Regiment who were planted round the place with their Pikes, and others upon Scaffolds, and ſome at the Windows of the Palace; the Magnificence began by a Conſort of Trumpets, Hoe-boys, and other excellent Muſick, when the firſt thing that entered, was a Rock containing fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen <hi>Grottoes,</hi> which ſeemed to be drawn by the Lyre and Voice of an <hi>Amphion;</hi> on the top of all was a Tree, whoſe branches ſeemed to touch an azured Heaven beſpangled with Golden Stars, and it was followed by thirty
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:54948:97"/>Pages on Horſ-back, Armed with Launces: A little after this entred a Triumphant Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot, repreſenting Glory, drawn by eight White Steeds, with Wings on their Backs; in the middle was erected a Pyramid of Silver, whoſe point touches a Sphere of Gold, upon which was wrote this Motto <hi>(Here I am li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted)</hi> to ſhew that Glory reacheth as far as the Heavens; but can no further; this <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramid</hi> was imbraced by a young Virgin, Cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Cloath of Silver, with a Circle of Gold upon her head to figure Glory; on each ſide of her was two other Images, that on her right hand repreſenting Victory, that on the other Renown: This was alſo attended by an infinite number of Pages, Heralds at Arms, and others; when theſe were gone, then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared the Chariot of the Sun, drawn by eight Horſes cloathed in Gold-colour'd Sat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin; covered with Suns and Roſes, conducted by <hi>Phaeton</hi> as Coachman; at one end was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented <hi>Aurora,</hi> and within it the four ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the Year, and the twelve hours of the day; all thoſe that followed it were dreſſed in Cloaths and Liveries ſuitable to their qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities. When this was gone, the next that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd was the Mountain <hi>Menelaus</hi> full of lively green Trees, Graſs, Fountains and Birds, drove by the god <hi>Pan,</hi> as if he were going in ſearch of the Nimph <hi>Syringna</hi> and thoſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to <hi>Diana;</hi> the laſt that came was a Charriot drawn by twelve horſes cloathed in Orange-colour'd Sattin and Blew Embroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:54948:98"/>with Gold and Silver, conducted by ſix Men in Satten Robes of the ſame Colour Embroidered; on the Top of all ſate an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Woman, full of Wrincles and Gray Hairs, figuring a Magician; at her Feet were a company of Young Men, with ſeveral mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical Inſtruments in their Hands, and behind the Chariot was a Mountain. When it ſtood ſtill before the Scaffold where the King and Queen were, and the Muſique beginning to play, the Magician, making many Circles with a Rod ſhe held in her Hand, commantled the Mountain to open, which it ſuddenly did; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing in a moment diverſe Birds of ſeveral kinds, who flew all out of it into the open Air: but at length Night put a ſtop to all, and our Lovers muſt leave the pleaſures of this day to taſte others; which though of an other nature, yet I doubt not but they found them to be more pleaſing, after what they had ſuffered. Imagine then the Princeſs to be conducted to her Appartment, and ſo to her Bed; where like the ſmiling Morn ſhe lay in expectation of what had been ſo long defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: but 'tis ſuppoſed the Royal Bridegroom ſtayed not long behind her. Neither muſt we forget the fair <hi>Clarinda,</hi> who ſtrived to hide her bluſhes from her <hi>Coriander,</hi> under the ſpiteful Bed-cloaths: but he ſoon cauſed the Taper to be extinguiſhed, that the Sables of the night might eaſe her of that trouble, and do him that injurious Office. Him we will leave then in his Loves embraces, to obſerve
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:54948:98"/>the fair <hi>Emilia,</hi> whoſe modeſty (which at that time did ſomething ill become her) did clearly evidence how between willingneſs and unwillingneſs, ſhe received the firſt tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſports of her <hi>Orontus.</hi> Let this ſuffice, and let us not be too curious in our farther ſearch, nor pry into the privacy of Lovers, but leave them to the care of <hi>Hymen;</hi> who no doubt will accompliſh their deſires.</p>
